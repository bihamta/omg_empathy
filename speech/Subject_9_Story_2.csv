impacted,254.8,255.2
my,255.2,255.3
self-esteem,255.3,255.8
kind,255.8,256.4
of,256.4,256.5
because,256.5,256.7
I'm,256.7,256.8
a,256.8,256.9
very,256.9,257.1
afraid,257.1,257.3
I,257.3,257.5
was,257.5,257.7
very,257.7,257.9
fragile,257.9,258.1
person,258.1,258.4
my,258.4,258.7
self-esteem,258.7,265.1
still,265.1,266.4
at,266.4,266.7
times,266.7,267.1
that,267.1,267.4
it,267.4,267.4
was,267.4,267.6
very,267.6,267.7
difficult,267.7,268.0
for,268.0,268.1
me,268.1,268.2
to,268.2,268.3
handle,268.3,268.4
that,268.4,268.6
kind,268.6,268.8
of,268.8,268.9
negative,268.9,269.3
feedback,269.3,270.6
kind,270.6,271.1
of,271.1,271.3
business,271.3,276.3
is,276.3,276.4
not,276.4,276.6
working,276.6,277.0
I,277.0,277.1
can't,277.1,277.5
deal,277.5,277.6
with,277.6,277.9
the,277.9,278.0
teacher,278.0,278.4
I,278.4,278.4
don't,278.4,278.6
want,278.6,278.8
to,278.8,279.0
do,279.0,282.2
anything,282.2,282.7
like,282.7,282.9
this,282.9,283.1
before,283.1,285.2
but,285.2,285.6
easily,287.8,288.3
Tangled,288.3,288.6
so,292.2,292.6
we,292.6,292.8
couldn't,292.8,293.0
really,293.0,293.4
hear,293.4,294.1
much,294.1,294.3
about,294.3,294.4
that,294.4,294.6
the,294.6,294.9
court,294.9,295.1
system,295.1,295.4
mandatory,295.4,296.1
so,296.1,296.6
it's,296.6,296.8
like,296.8,297.1
she,297.1,297.3
still,297.3,297.5
be,297.5,297.7
around,297.7,297.8
kind,297.8,298.7
of,298.7,298.7
energy,298.7,298.9
made,298.9,299.3
people's,299.3,299.6
life,299.6,299.8
difficult,299.8,299.9
anyway,299.9,300.3
when,300.3,300.6
they,300.6,300.7
went,300.7,300.9
to,300.9,300.9
their,300.9,301.0
claws,301.0,301.4
so,301.4,301.6
we,301.6,301.7
discussed,301.7,302.0
possibly,302.0,302.6
like,302.6,302.9
just,302.9,303.4
cuz,304.3,305.2
we,305.2,305.2
had,305.2,305.4
today,305.4,305.5
was,305.5,305.7

with,307.9,308.1
music,308.1,309.0
school,309.0,309.2

can,309.7,310.3
transfer,310.3,310.7
my,310.7,311.8
