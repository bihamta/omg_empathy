he,246.8,248.5
said,248.5,248.6
he,248.6,248.7
didn't,248.7,249.0
last,249.0,249.2
too,249.2,250.2

and,254.4,255.2
then,255.2,255.2
she,255.2,255.4
eventually,255.4,255.7
let,255.7,255.9
me,255.9,256.1
know,256.1,256.2
that,256.2,256.4
she,256.4,256.8
her,256.8,257.3
dad,257.3,257.6
is,257.6,257.7

in,258.2,258.4
Asia,258.4,258.8
essentially,258.8,259.4
so,259.4,260.2
that,260.2,260.3
means,260.3,260.6
to,260.6,260.6
turn,260.6,260.8
the,260.8,261.0
family,261.0,261.3
had,261.3,261.4
to,261.4,261.4
move,261.4,261.7
kind,261.7,262.6
of,262.6,262.7
this,262.7,264.6
is,264.6,264.8
really,264.8,265.0
worried,265.0,265.4
me,265.4,265.5
kind,265.5,265.8
of,265.8,265.9
cuz,265.9,266.1
I,266.1,266.2
was,266.2,266.4
always,266.4,266.6
be,266.6,266.8
like,266.8,267.0
so,267.0,267.2
fragile,267.2,267.9
and,267.9,268.5
like,268.5,268.9
losing,268.9,271.3
a,271.3,271.4
friend,271.4,271.8
kind,271.8,272.0
of,272.0,272.1
craving,272.1,272.7
learn,272.7,273.1

exchange,273.2,274.2
phone,274.2,274.6

so,275.1,275.5
we,275.5,275.6
can,275.6,275.8
chat,275.8,276.1
when,276.1,276.3

didn't,277.8,278.1
really,278.1,278.3
work,278.3,278.6
so,278.6,279.2

call,279.6,279.7
her,279.7,280.0

just,280.3,280.3
couldn't,280.3,280.7
get,280.7,281.0
through,281.0,281.3

a,284.8,284.8
bit,284.8,285.0
before,285.0,285.2
like,285.2,285.5
the,285.5,285.6
whole,285.6,285.8
social,285.8,286.0
media,286.0,286.4
things,286.4,286.8
that,286.8,286.9
we,286.9,287.0
couldn't,287.0,287.1
really,287.1,287.3

touch,287.6,287.8
that,287.8,288.0
way,288.0,288.0
either,288.0,288.4
so,288.4,290.9
we,290.9,291.1
kind,291.1,291.3
of,291.3,291.4
lost,291.4,291.8
contact,291.8,292.3
for,292.3,292.4
a,292.4,292.4
while,292.4,292.7
we,292.7,292.8
lost,292.8,292.9
contact,292.9,293.1
for,293.1,293.5
a,293.5,295.3
long,295.3,295.6
time,295.6,295.7
I,295.7,295.9
think,295.9,296.0
about,296.0,296.1
5,296.1,296.6
years,296.6,297.0
eventually,297.0,298.1
she,298.1,298.4
did,298.4,298.7
contact,298.7,299.3
me,299.3,299.5
again,299.5,299.7
the,299.7,308.5
best,308.5,308.7
kind,308.7,309.1
of,309.1,309.3
Miami,309.3,309.9
football,309.9,310.1
is,310.1,310.4
what,310.4,310.6
the,310.6,310.7
past,310.7,311.1
what,311.1,311.2
we,311.2,311.3
doing,311.3,311.6
currently,311.6,311.9
and,311.9,312.2
stuff,312.2,312.5
like,312.5,312.8
that,312.8,312.8
and,312.8,314.4
there's,314.4,314.8
one,314.8,314.9
thing,314.9,315.0
I,315.0,315.1
did,315.1,315.2
notice,315.2,315.4
that,315.4,315.5
definitely,315.5,316.1
we,316.1,317.2
both,317.2,317.4
had,317.4,317.5
changed,317.5,317.9
quite,317.9,318.1
a,318.1,318.3
lot,318.3,318.5
kind,318.5,319.0
of,319.0,319.1
would,319.1,319.3
like,319.3,319.4
she,319.4,319.7
changed,319.7,320.0
it,320.0,320.0
on,320.0,320.1
my,320.1,320.3
head,320.3,320.7
has,320.7,321.0
you,321.0,321.1
very,321.1,321.4
much,321.4,321.8
but,321.8,321.9
at,321.9,322.2
this,322.2,322.3
point,322.3,322.4
in,322.4,322.7
time,322.7,322.8
at,322.8,323.3
it,323.3,324.0
like,324.0,324.7
this,324.7,324.8
we,324.8,326.2
were,326.2,326.3
very,326.3,326.5
different,326.5,326.8
people,326.8,327.1
we,327.1,327.3
didn't,327.3,327.5
have,327.5,327.6
that,327.6,327.8
much,327.8,327.9
in,327.9,328.1
common,328.1,328.1
anymore,328.1,328.5
So,328.5,330.6
eventually,330.6,331.0
I'm,331.0,332.5
just,332.5,332.5
kind,332.5,332.8
of,332.8,332.9
died,332.9,333.5
out,333.5,333.8
then,333.8,334.1
the,334.1,334.3
fortunately,334.3,334.8
we,334.8,335.0
haven't,335.0,335.3
really,335.3,335.5
talked,335.5,335.9
since,335.9,336.2
then,336.2,336.5
kinds,336.5,337.2
of,337.2,337.3
I,340.6,342.0
guess,342.0,342.3
that,342.3,342.4
happens,342.4,342.7
to,342.7,343.1
people,343.1,343.8
people,343.8,344.7
grow,344.7,345.2
and,345.2,345.3
mature,345.3,345.6
