didn't,22.9,23.2
really,23.2,23.4
like,23.4,23.8
they,23.8,24.1
treated,24.1,24.4
it,24.4,24.5
more,24.5,24.8
is,24.8,24.9
a,24.9,24.9
kind,24.9,25.2
of,25.2,25.3
effect,25.3,25.6
of,25.6,25.7
fantasies,25.7,26.3
we,26.3,26.4
didn't,26.4,26.7
really,26.7,26.8

some,82.0,82.3
kind,82.3,82.7
of,82.7,82.8
evil,82.8,83.4
demon,83.4,84.0

was,85.9,86.1
pretty,86.1,86.4
awful,86.4,86.7
as,86.7,86.9
a,86.9,87.0
human,87.0,87.2
being,87.2,87.4
she,87.4,87.6
was,87.6,87.8
mean,87.8,88.3
and,88.3,88.6
judgmental,88.6,88.9
and,88.9,89.5
spiteful,89.5,91.5
to,91.5,91.9
teach,91.9,94.9
children,94.9,95.1
made,100.9,101.7

friends,106.2,106.8
and,106.8,106.9
actually,106.9,107.1
think,107.1,113.0
about,113.0,113.1
the,113.1,113.4
good,113.4,113.7
guy,113.7,114.0

can,132.4,132.6
understand,132.6,133.0
introverts,133.0,133.2
then,133.2,137.3

have,137.4,137.5
to,137.5,137.6
put,137.6,137.7
into,137.7,138.0
this,138.0,138.4

pillows,154.9,155.1
and,155.1,155.2
stuff,155.2,155.4
but,155.4,155.5
then,155.5,155.8
she,155.8,156.1
just,156.1,156.3
kind,156.3,156.5
of,156.5,156.7
shredded,156.7,157.4
my,157.4,158.1
presentation,158.1,158.4
she,158.4,159.1
said,159.1,159.3
this,159.3,159.6
was,159.6,159.9
wrong,159.9,160.1
he,160.1,160.3
was,160.3,160.4
a,160.4,160.5
quiet,160.5,160.7
about,160.7,161.0
this,161.0,161.2
why,161.2,161.5
didn't,161.5,161.7
you,161.7,161.8
do,161.8,161.9
this,161.9,162.1
better,162.1,162.3
and,162.3,163.5
I,163.5,163.8
couldn't,163.8,165.4
handle,165.4,165.6
this,165.6,165.9
kind,165.9,166.2
of,166.2,166.4
I,166.4,166.4
just,166.4,166.5
kind,166.5,166.9
of,166.9,166.9
broke,166.9,167.6
down,167.6,167.9
I,167.9,168.3
went,168.3,168.4
home,168.4,168.7

my,168.9,168.9
parents,168.9,169.1

take,171.7,171.9
the,171.9,172.1
schools,172.1,172.5

this,173.4,173.5
one,173.5,173.7
teacher,173.7,174.0
likely,174.0,174.4
come,174.4,174.7
get,174.7,175.1
with,175.1,175.3
her,175.3,175.4
eventually,175.4,175.8
I,175.8,176.0
could,176.0,176.2
too,176.2,176.3
much,176.3,176.5
we,176.5,176.8
talked,176.8,177.0
to,177.0,177.2
the,177.2,177.2
school,177.2,177.4
and,177.4,178.6
the,178.6,178.7
school,178.7,178.8
deal,183.9,184.4
with,184.4,184.6
assumptions,184.6,184.9
of,184.9,185.3
what,185.3,185.4
we,185.4,185.6
did,185.6,185.9
to,185.9,186.1
receive,186.1,186.4
a,186.4,186.6
strange,186.6,186.9
like,186.9,187.2
a,187.2,187.3
transfer,187.3,187.6
back,187.6,187.8
over,187.8,187.9
to,187.9,188.2
it,188.2,188.2
like,188.2,188.5
a,188.5,188.6
normal,188.6,188.9
high,188.9,189.2
school,189.2,189.3
but,189.3,189.7
should,189.7,189.8
have,189.8,189.9
all,189.9,190.0
the,190.0,190.1

that,200.0,200.3
Mexican,200.3,201.3
