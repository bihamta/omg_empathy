it,205.7,205.9
was,205.9,206.0
not,206.0,206.4
the,206.4,206.5

then,215.2,215.4
suddenly,215.4,215.6
there's,215.6,217.6
a,217.6,217.6
Norseman,217.6,218.2
that,218.2,218.4
well,218.4,218.6

in,227.3,227.3
this,227.3,227.4

was,228.7,228.8
going,228.8,229.1

time,233.8,233.9
Sunday,233.9,235.4
I,235.4,235.6
felt,235.6,236.0
like,236.0,236.2
this,236.2,236.4
plane,236.4,236.8
was,236.8,237.0
falling,237.0,237.4

Dublin,238.8,239.2
sometimes,239.2,239.6
it's,239.6,239.8
falls,239.8,240.2
down,240.2,240.4
and,240.4,241.2
it's,241.2,241.4
not,241.4,242.0
like,242.0,242.2
a,242.2,242.2
small,242.2,242.6
one,242.6,242.8
just,242.8,242.9
fell,242.9,243.2
down,243.2,243.5
for,243.5,243.7
like,243.7,243.9
300,243.9,244.3
feet,244.3,244.9
I,244.9,245.0

or,256.7,256.8
something,256.8,257.1
is,257.1,257.3
really,257.3,257.5
scary,257.5,258.1
and,258.1,258.9
then,258.9,259.2
all,259.2,259.6
of,259.6,259.6
a,259.6,259.8
sudden,259.8,259.8
these,259.8,260.2

I've,265.0,265.4
never,265.4,265.5
experienced,265.5,265.9
