she,359.4,365.7
did,365.7,365.9
get,365.9,366.0
the,366.0,366.2
kontakt,366.2,366.5
5,366.5,366.7
years,366.7,366.9
later,366.9,367.1
though,367.1,367.5
via,367.5,367.9
Facebook,367.9,368.3
so,368.3,377.4
music,377.4,377.8
suggestions,377.8,378.3
like,378.3,378.4
this,378.4,378.9
guy,378.9,379.1
movie,379.1,389.6
Walter,389.6,390.0
we,390.0,390.1
doing,390.1,390.3
at,390.3,390.4
the,390.4,390.5
moment,390.5,390.6
in,390.6,391.2
life,391.2,391.4
I,395.4,395.8
wish,395.8,396.0
the,396.0,396.1
branch,396.1,396.3
arise,396.3,396.5
that,396.5,396.6
she,396.6,396.8
changed,396.8,397.0
quite,397.0,397.5
all,397.5,397.6
those,397.6,397.9
other,397.9,398.1
person,398.1,398.6
I,398.6,398.7
guess,398.7,399.0
so,399.0,399.2
it,399.2,399.3
has,399.3,399.8
been,399.8,399.9
5,399.9,400.3
years,400.3,400.4
ago,400.4,400.9
so,400.9,407.6
the,407.6,407.7
conversation,407.7,407.9
kind,407.9,409.4
of,409.4,409.5
very,409.5,409.9
enthusiastic,409.9,410.0
that,410.0,410.8
time,410.8,411.1
went,411.1,411.2
on,411.2,411.3
the,411.3,411.5
kind,411.5,411.8
of,411.8,411.8
like,411.8,412.2
to,412.2,412.6
do,412.6,412.7
now,412.7,412.9
to,412.9,413.0
mintwood,413.0,413.5
the,413.5,413.7
end,413.7,413.9
it,413.9,414.0
really,414.0,414.1
like,414.1,414.6
it,414.6,415.3
was,415.3,415.4
very,415.4,415.4
short,415.4,415.8
responses,415.8,416.6
and,416.6,416.9
like,416.9,417.3
he,417.3,417.5
was,417.5,417.6
very,417.6,417.7
enthusiastic,417.7,417.9
probably,417.9,419.8
just,419.8,419.9
kind,419.9,420.1
of,420.1,420.1
stuff,420.1,420.3
and,420.3,423.0
I,423.0,423.1
haven't,423.1,423.3
heard,423.3,423.4
from,423.4,424.0
her,424.0,424.1
since,424.1,424.3
then,424.3,424.5
I,424.5,425.3
guess,425.3,425.6
that's,425.6,425.8
part,425.8,426.2
of,426.2,426.3
growing,426.3,426.7
up,426.7,426.9
is,426.9,427.1
anxious,427.1,427.4
the,427.4,427.6
people,427.6,428.0
change,428.0,428.2
in,428.2,428.5
you,428.5,428.7
separate,428.7,432.1
relationships,432.1,433.1
in,433.1,433.3
as,433.3,433.7
a,433.7,433.8
revolving,433.8,434.2
than,434.2,434.6
two,434.6,434.7
relationships,434.7,435.0
are,435.0,435.6
also,435.6,435.8
evolving,435.8,436.3
