how,0.0,0.8
are,0.8,0.9
you,0.9,1.1
doing,1.1,1.5
good,1.5,1.8
was,3.7,4.1
high,4.1,4.3
school,4.3,4.5
how,4.5,4.7
was,4.7,4.8
your,4.8,5.0
high,5.0,5.2
school,5.2,5.2
time,5.2,5.7
okay,8.8,21.0
from,21.0,21.6
you,21.6,21.8
was,21.8,22.0
on,22.0,22.0
the,22.0,22.1
second,22.1,22.5
part,22.5,22.6
so,22.6,23.0
it,23.0,23.1
was,23.1,23.2
not,23.2,23.3
that,23.3,23.5
good,23.5,23.7
yeah,23.7,24.6
I,24.6,25.0
change,25.0,25.6
it,25.6,25.8
change,25.8,27.0
it,27.0,27.1
school,27.1,27.3
there,27.3,33.1
and,33.1,33.3
grew,33.3,33.4
up,33.4,33.6
there,33.6,33.8
they're,33.8,34.3
together,34.3,34.5
these,34.5,35.0
and,35.0,35.2
I,35.2,35.3
just,35.3,35.5
arrived,35.5,36.0
and,36.0,36.6
middle,36.6,36.9
high,36.9,37.0
school,37.0,37.3
you,37.3,37.5
know,37.5,37.5
teenage,37.5,37.9
times,37.9,38.3
and,38.3,38.5
got,38.5,39.3
the,39.3,39.4
best,39.4,39.5
option,39.5,39.9
I,39.9,39.9
guess,39.9,40.0
so,40.0,45.1
I,45.1,45.1
was,45.1,45.3
always,45.3,45.4
the,45.4,46.1
best,46.1,47.2
old,47.2,60.5
style,60.5,60.8
teaching,60.8,61.0
without,61.0,61.5
much,61.5,61.8
did,61.8,62.0
that,62.0,62.2
takes,62.2,62.5
just,62.5,63.4
this,63.4,63.6
autocorrect,63.6,64.1
thing,64.1,64.3
that,64.3,64.8
I,64.8,65.1
teach,65.1,65.5
you,65.5,65.6
learned,65.6,65.9
that's,65.9,66.0
all,66.0,66.3
that's,66.3,67.0
why,67.0,67.2
right,67.2,67.5
here,67.5,67.8
you,67.8,68.0
coming,68.0,68.2
your,68.2,68.5
way,68.5,68.5
what,68.8,69.0
book,69.0,69.2
in,69.2,69.4
itself,69.4,69.6
is,69.6,70.4
not,70.4,70.7
the,70.7,71.1
best,71.1,71.2
idea,71.2,71.6
I,71.6,71.8
think,71.8,72.0
it's,72.0,80.9
from,80.9,81.1
you,81.1,81.2
but,81.2,81.4
he,81.4,81.5
said,81.5,81.6
he,81.6,81.7
was,81.7,81.9
always,81.9,82.0
memorizing,82.0,83.4

places,86.0,86.4
and,86.4,86.6
stuff,86.6,86.8
like,86.8,87.1
that,87.1,87.1
okay,115.8,117.0
I,117.0,120.9
started,120.9,121.5
to,121.5,121.6
get,121.6,121.7
to,121.7,122.2
like,122.2,122.5
this,122.5,122.7
kind,122.7,122.9
of,122.9,123.0
thing,123.0,123.3
it,123.3,123.8
was,123.8,128.0
the,128.0,128.0
first,128.0,128.2
time,128.2,128.3
the,128.3,128.5
teacher,128.5,128.8
approached,128.8,129.3
the,129.3,129.4
students,129.4,129.8
like,129.8,130.1
one-to-one,130.1,130.7
conversation,130.7,130.8
of,130.8,131.4

how,133.0,133.2
things,133.2,133.4
are,133.4,133.6
going,133.6,133.8
motivated,133.8,140.6
you,140.6,140.8
are,140.8,140.9
always,140.9,141.3
here,141.3,141.6
asking,141.6,141.9
questions,141.9,142.0
what,142.0,142.6
happened,142.6,143.0
why,143.0,143.1
you,143.1,143.3
fail,143.3,143.8
and,143.8,144.3

also,145.0,145.2
to,145.2,145.9
study,145.9,148.8
more,148.8,149.0
efficiently,149.0,149.1

that's,165.2,165.3
okay,165.3,165.7
that's,165.7,165.8
getting,165.8,166.6
weird,166.6,167.0
and,167.0,167.3
then,167.3,167.3
otherwise,167.3,176.9
