words,start,end
okay,0.5,1.0
so,1.0,1.3
how,1.3,1.3
you,1.3,1.5
doing,1.5,1.5
today,1.5,1.8
nice,1.8,2.8
to,2.8,5.4
like,5.4,5.6
traveling,5.6,6.0
I've,10.7,11.1
been,11.1,11.3
trying,11.3,11.7
for.,11.7,12.4
That's,12.4,12.6
why,12.6,13.0
I,13.0,13.4
like,13.4,16.2
traveling,16.2,16.6
a,16.6,16.7
lot,16.7,16.8
of,16.8,17.4
experience,17.4,23.2
but,23.2,23.4
a,23.4,23.6
couple,23.6,25.9
of,25.9,26.0
weeks,26.0,26.5
back,26.5,26.8
I,26.8,26.9
was,26.9,27.1
traveling,27.1,27.5
to,27.5,27.7
process,27.7,28.1
normally,28.1,29.6
I,29.6,29.9
would,29.9,30.1
take,30.1,30.2
the,30.2,30.4
train,30.4,30.6
because,30.6,30.8
it's,30.8,31.1
not,31.1,31.3
that,31.3,31.5
far,31.5,31.7
but,31.7,32.2
I,32.2,32.5
found,32.5,32.7
this,32.7,32.9
could,32.9,33.6
be,33.6,33.7
land,33.7,34.2
on,34.2,34.4
this,34.4,34.5
website,34.5,34.8
so,34.8,35.3
I,35.3,35.3
could,35.3,35.5
take,35.5,35.6
a,35.6,35.7
flight,35.7,36.0
for,36.0,36.1
really,36.1,36.4
cheap,36.4,36.7
I,36.7,37.4
wish,37.4,37.7
I,37.7,37.7
didn't,37.7,37.9
realize,37.9,38.2
there,38.2,38.3
was,38.3,38.4
an,38.4,38.6
evening,38.6,38.9
flight,38.9,39.2
I,39.2,39.4
mean,39.4,39.7
if,39.7,39.9
I,39.9,40.0
can,40.0,40.1
find,40.1,40.4
but,40.4,40.5
this,40.5,40.7
was,40.7,40.9
something,40.9,42.1
you,42.1,42.8
know,42.8,43.0
like,43.0,43.1
the,43.1,43.4
like,43.4,44.5
the,44.5,44.5
last,44.5,44.8
flight,44.8,45.1
of,45.1,45.2
the,45.2,45.3
day,45.3,45.5
or,45.5,45.8
something,45.8,46.1
so,46.1,47.0
I,47.0,47.1
went,47.1,47.3
to,47.3,47.4
the,47.4,47.5
airport,47.5,47.7
couple,47.7,48.8
of,48.8,48.8
hours,48.8,49.0
early,49.0,49.1
in,49.1,50.0
the,50.0,50.1
morning,50.1,50.9
time,50.9,51.4
as,51.4,51.8
normally,51.8,52.2
do,52.2,52.3
with,52.3,53.1
the,53.1,53.3
storm,53.3,53.6
evening,53.6,54.3
kind,54.3,54.9
of,54.9,55.0
like,55.0,55.2
raining,55.2,55.5
and,55.5,55.8
really,55.8,56.0
dark,56.0,56.5
as,56.5,57.2
I,57.2,57.3
reach,57.3,57.5
the,57.5,57.6
airport,57.6,57.8
I,57.8,58.1
see,58.1,58.2
this,58.2,58.4
long,58.4,59.1
queue,59.1,59.5
for,59.5,60.0
checking,60.0,60.4
apparently,60.4,61.1
the,61.1,61.7
most,61.7,62.1
of,62.1,62.2
the,62.2,62.3
flights,62.3,62.6
were,62.6,62.7
delayed,62.7,62.7
that,62.7,63.2
day,63.2,63.4
and,63.4,63.6
the,63.6,63.8
the,63.8,64.5
airport,64.5,64.8
was,64.8,65.0
full,65.0,65.3
of,65.3,65.4
people,65.4,65.6
it,65.6,65.9
was,65.9,66.0
really,66.0,66.2
so,66.2,66.6
crowded,66.6,66.8
so,66.8,67.8
it,67.8,67.9
took,67.9,68.0
me,68.0,68.1
a,68.1,68.2
long,68.2,68.4
time,68.4,68.6
for,68.6,68.9
the,68.9,69.0
second,69.0,69.3
to,69.3,69.4
happen,69.4,69.7
even,69.7,69.8
though,69.8,70.0
at,70.0,70.1
least,70.1,70.1
like,70.1,70.5
to,70.5,70.6
how,70.6,70.8
is,70.8,71.0
before,71.0,71.3
the,71.3,71.4
time,71.4,71.7
so,71.7,72.9
I,72.9,72.9
could,72.9,73.1
barely,73.1,73.4
manage,73.4,74.0
to,74.0,74.2
get,74.2,74.3
to,74.3,74.6
the,74.6,74.8
boarding,74.8,75.2
before,75.2,75.8
they,75.8,75.9
close,75.9,76.1
the,76.1,76.3
boarding,76.3,76.6
like,76.6,76.8
10,76.8,77.0
minutes,77.0,77.3
before,77.3,77.5
they,77.5,77.7
close,77.7,78.0
to,78.0,78.1
voting,78.1,78.4
that's,78.4,80.6
why,80.6,80.8
I,80.8,80.9
went,80.9,81.1
in,81.1,81.4
for,81.4,83.3
the,83.3,83.5
board,83.5,83.8
they,83.8,84.4
don't,84.4,84.6
have,84.6,86.1
this,86.1,86.3
bridge,86.3,86.8
to,86.8,87.2
the,87.2,87.3
flight,87.3,87.7
that,87.7,87.9
you,87.9,88.0
have,88.0,88.1
to,88.1,88.2
take,88.2,88.3
the,88.3,88.4
bus,88.4,88.8
to,88.8,89.0
the,89.0,89.2
flight,89.2,89.5
it,89.5,90.0
was,90.0,90.0
that,90.0,90.3
and,90.3,90.4
I,90.4,90.5
hate,90.5,90.6
that,90.6,90.8
actually,90.8,91.4
just,91.4,92.2
go,92.2,93.0
to,93.0,93.1
the,93.1,93.3
bridge,93.3,93.5
but,93.5,94.3
we,94.3,94.4
took,94.4,94.6
the,94.6,94.7
bus,94.7,95.0
and,95.0,95.3
when,95.3,96.0
we,96.0,96.1
reach,96.1,96.4
the,96.4,96.6
plane,96.6,97.2
we,97.2,97.5
I,97.5,97.6
see,97.6,97.9
that,97.9,98.3
it's,98.3,98.9
not,98.9,99.0
a,99.0,99.2
big,99.2,99.4
penis,99.4,99.6
to,99.6,99.8
small,99.8,100.0
70c,100.0,101.2
propeller,101.2,101.8
plane,101.8,102.3
plans,102.3,107.0
because,107.0,107.2
I,107.2,109.5
like,109.5,109.8
this,109.8,110.0
20,114.7,115.2
baby,115.2,115.6
what,115.6,115.7
kind,115.7,115.9
of,115.9,115.9
like,115.9,116.2
the,116.2,116.4
fight,116.4,116.6
was,116.6,116.8
getting,116.8,116.8
late,116.8,117.4
so,117.4,117.5
you're,117.5,117.7
forced,117.7,118.1
to,118.1,118.2
just,118.2,118.5
bored,118.5,119.2
as,119.2,119.3
quickly,119.3,119.6
as,119.6,119.7
possible,119.7,119.8
sit,119.8,120.5
down,120.5,120.9
because,120.9,122.0
they,122.0,122.2
wanted,122.2,122.4
to,122.4,122.5
prepare,122.5,122.7
everything,122.7,123.0
and,123.0,123.3
leaving,123.3,123.5
time,123.5,124.0
and,124.0,125.0
as,125.0,125.1
it,125.1,125.2
turns,125.2,125.6
out,125.6,125.7
that,125.7,126.6
I'm,126.6,127.3
actually,127.3,127.6
was,127.6,127.8
there,127.8,128.0
for,128.0,128.2
the,128.2,128.4
flight,128.4,128.7
to,128.7,128.8
start,128.8,129.2
that,129.2,129.3
was,129.3,129.5
an,129.5,129.6
Austrian,129.6,129.9
saying,129.9,130.2
that,130.2,130.4
the,130.4,131.2
air,131.2,132.5
traffic,132.5,132.8
controllers,132.8,133.5
told,133.5,133.7
us,133.7,133.9
not,133.9,134.1
to,134.1,134.3
fly,134.3,134.5
from,134.5,134.8
now,134.8,135.0
because,135.0,135.3
when,135.3,135.8
their,135.8,136.0
flights,136.0,136.2
before,136.2,136.6
the,136.6,136.8
spell,136.8,137.3
eight,137.3,137.6
and,137.6,137.8
a,137.8,138.5
star,138.5,139.0
means,139.0,139.4
on,139.4,139.4
his,139.4,139.6
bed,139.6,140.1
of,140.1,140.2
Lies,140.2,140.3
we've,140.3,140.7
been,140.7,140.8
told,140.8,141.0
not,141.0,141.2
to,141.2,141.4
fly,141.4,141.7
at,141.7,142.0
that,142.0,142.1
particular,142.1,142.3
time,142.3,142.6
so,142.6,143.1
we,143.1,143.2
said,143.2,143.4
if,143.4,143.9
you,143.9,144.0
have,144.0,144.0
to,144.0,144.2
wait,144.2,144.5
after,144.5,145.4
yeah,145.4,145.7
but,145.7,145.9
that,145.9,146.1
what,146.1,146.2
you,146.2,146.3
would,146.3,146.4
be,146.4,146.6
forcing,146.6,147.2
us,147.2,147.5
to,147.5,147.5
sit,147.5,147.7
down,147.7,147.8
now,147.8,148.2
and,148.2,148.4
now,148.4,148.6
you're,148.6,148.7
telling,148.7,149.1
us,149.1,149.3
that,149.3,149.4
we,149.4,149.5
have,149.5,149.6
to,149.6,149.7
wait,149.7,149.9
for,149.9,150.0
sometimes,150.0,150.6
it,150.6,150.8
could,150.8,150.9
have,150.9,151.0
been,151.0,151.2
lied,151.2,151.8
to,151.8,151.9
us,151.9,152.2
at,152.2,154.7
that,154.7,154.9
time,154.9,155.2
because,155.2,161.1
they,161.1,162.1
were,162.1,162.3
just,162.3,162.5
move,162.5,163.1
and,163.1,163.8
you,163.8,163.9
know,163.9,164.0
they,164.0,164.1
don't,164.1,164.3
even,164.3,164.6
switch,164.6,164.8
on,164.8,165.1
the,165.1,165.2
air,165.2,165.3
conditioning,165.3,165.9
while,165.9,166.5
the,166.5,166.7
flight,166.7,167.1
is,167.1,167.3
not,167.3,167.6
started,167.6,168.5
countries,168.5,170.1
properly,170.1,170.6
it's,170.6,171.0
really,171.0,171.2
hot,171.2,171.6

fine,174.4,174.6
I'm,174.7,174.9
so,174.9,175.1
sorry,175.1,175.5
but,175.5,175.8
it's,175.8,176.0

really,177.4,177.8
packed,177.8,178.2
inside,178.2,178.7
and,178.7,179.0
I,179.0,179.0
get,179.0,179.2
really,179.2,179.4
claustrophobic,179.4,179.7
and,179.7,180.4
I,180.4,180.5
do,180.5,180.7
like,180.7,181.1
those,181.1,181.3
places,181.3,181.7
that's,181.7,182.6
a,182.6,182.6

small,182.8,183.1
plant,183.1,183.6
playing,183.6,183.9

lot,197.4,197.6
of,197.6,197.6
turbulence,197.6,197.9

as,198.8,198.9
soon,198.9,199.0
as,199.0,199.1
we,199.1,199.3

and,220.6,220.9
it,220.9,222.8
was,222.8,223.0
just,223.0,223.1
it,223.1,224.0

shouldn't,228.8,229.0
be,229.0,229.0
that,229.0,229.1
bad,229.1,229.5
that's,229.5,230.4
why,230.4,230.6
I,230.6,230.6

this,276.2,276.7
is,276.7,276.8

I've,285.3,285.6
had,285.6,285.6
this,285.6,285.9
way,285.9,286.0
you,286.0,286.1
have,286.1,286.2
to,286.2,286.4
wear,286.4,286.6
the,286.6,286.7
oxygen,286.7,286.8

I,289.9,290.2
couldn't,290.2,290.6
breathe,290.6,290.8
because,290.8,291.1
I,291.1,291.7
was,291.7,291.9
feeling,291.9,292.1
so,292.1,292.4
weird,292.4,292.7
for,292.7,292.8
me,292.8,293.0
to,293.0,293.2
be,293.2,294.0
claustrophobic,294.0,294.3

as,295.4,295.4
down,295.4,295.7
I,295.7,295.9
felt,295.9,296.1
really,296.1,296.3
hard,296.3,296.6
and,296.6,297.1
I,297.1,297.2
was,297.2,297.4
struggling,297.4,297.8
with,297.8,298.0
the,298.0,298.1
rocks,298.1,298.3
in,298.3,298.5
Mass,298.5,298.7
I,298.7,298.8
can,298.8,299.0

a,301.6,301.7
clipboard,301.7,302.0
on,302.0,302.2
so,302.2,302.4
I,302.4,302.4
can,302.4,302.5
receive,302.5,302.8
it.,302.8,303.4
After,303.4,303.7
that,303.7,304.0
but,304.0,304.6
it,304.6,304.6
was,304.6,304.7
like,304.7,304.9
scary,304.9,305.5
and,305.5,305.7
how,305.7,305.8
do,305.8,305.9
I,305.9,306.0
thought,306.0,306.8
I,306.8,306.8
would,306.8,307.0
be,307.0,307.0
even,307.0,308.1
before,308.1,308.2
the,308.2,308.6
flight,308.6,308.8
for,308.8,309.5
the,309.5,309.5
five,309.5,309.8
crashes,309.8,310.0
if,310.0,310.4
it,310.4,310.5
does,310.5,310.8
somehow,314.7,315.4
after,315.4,315.8
a,315.8,316.0
few,316.0,316.4
seconds,316.4,317.2
few,317.2,317.5
minutes,317.5,317.9
of,317.9,318.1
couple,318.1,318.4
of,318.4,318.4
minutes,318.4,318.8
the,318.8,318.8
flight,318.8,319.1
kind,319.1,319.4
of,319.4,319.4
stabilize,319.4,320.0
that,320.0,320.8
falling,320.8,321.3
feeling,321.3,321.4
start,321.4,322.0
for,322.0,322.2
some,322.2,322.4
time,322.4,322.7
and,322.7,323.9
it,323.9,324.1
felt,324.1,324.4
like,324.4,324.4
the,324.4,324.6
typos,324.6,324.9
again,324.9,325.1
gaining,325.1,325.7

at,325.8,327.6
the,327.6,327.7

on,328.1,328.2
again,328.2,328.5
and,328.5,329.0
they,329.0,329.3
also,329.3,329.6
says,329.6,330.0
that,330.0,330.2
we,330.2,330.5
will,330.5,330.7
have,330.7,331.2
to,331.2,331.4
stay,331.4,331.6
and,331.6,332.5
that's,332.5,332.9
why,332.9,333.2
this,333.2,333.9
happened,333.9,334.5
she,334.5,334.7
told,334.7,335.0
us,335.0,335.1
to,335.1,335.2
keep,335.2,335.4
the,335.4,335.5
oxygen,335.5,335.9
mask,335.9,336.2
for,336.2,336.4
some,336.4,336.6
time,336.6,337.0
before,337.0,337.4
we,337.4,337.7
needs,337.7,337.9
to,337.9,338.0
go.,338.0,338.3
And,338.3,338.8
then,338.8,338.9
we,338.9,339.1
could,339.1,339.2
take,339.2,339.4
it,339.4,339.4
off,339.4,339.7
it,339.7,341.6
was,341.6,341.8
just,341.8,341.9
beat,341.9,342.2
it,342.2,342.3
was,342.3,342.5
the,342.5,342.6
most,342.6,343.1
awful,343.1,343.2
thing,343.2,343.6
that,343.6,343.7
I,343.7,343.8
had,343.8,343.9
experience,343.9,344.4
probably,344.4,345.4
do,345.4,345.7
was,345.7,345.9
when,345.9,346.5
we,346.5,346.6

kind,348.1,348.4
of,348.4,348.5
stabilized,348.5,349.1
and,349.1,349.3
we,349.3,349.4
were,349.4,349.5
told,349.5,349.6
to,349.6,349.8
remove,349.8,350.0
oxygen,350.0,350.4
are,350.4,350.7
you,350.7,351.8
allowed,351.8,352.1

with,356.9,357.1
such,357.1,357.4
a,357.4,357.5
thing,357.5,357.5
happening,357.5,357.7
in,357.7,358.1
a,358.1,358.2
movement,358.2,359.6
it,359.6,361.5

The,364.0,365.0

twice,365.8,366.2
before,366.2,366.5
we,366.5,366.8
actually,366.8,367.0
stabilized,367.0,368.4
everything,368.4,369.9
that,369.9,370.1
was,370.1,370.9
going,370.9,370.9

in,371.2,371.6
that,371.6,371.9
flight,371.9,372.3
and,372.3,372.5
I,372.5,372.8
was,372.8,373.1
so,373.1,373.4
scared,373.4,373.7
of,373.7,373.9
flies,373.9,374.7
software,374.7,375.3

even,378.3,378.5
though,378.5,378.6
it,378.6,378.7
took,378.7,378.8
me,378.8,379.0
like,379.0,379.1
4,379.1,380.0
times,380.0,380.0
more,380.0,380.4

I'm,384.7,384.9
pretty,384.9,385.2
sure,385.2,385.3
I,385.3,385.5
will,385.5,385.7
never,385.7,385.9
