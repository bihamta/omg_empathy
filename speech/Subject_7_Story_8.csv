a,26.4,26.5
relatively,26.5,27.2
small,27.2,27.5

time,50.0,50.3
but,50.3,50.9
anyway,50.9,51.2

be,60.6,60.7
the,60.7,60.8
smelliest,60.8,61.3
food,61.3,61.6

supposed,71.3,71.8
to,71.8,71.9
be,71.9,71.9
thing,71.9,72.7
that,72.7,72.9
I,72.9,73.3

it,73.5,73.6
smells,73.6,73.9
thing,73.9,74.1
in,74.1,74.2
the,74.2,74.3
world,74.3,74.4
even,74.4,76.1
some,76.1,77.1
