doing,0.7000000000000001,0.8
a,0.8,2.7
couple,2.7,6.4
of,6.4,6.4
weeks,6.4,6.7
ago,6.7,6.8
you,6.8,9.4
like,9.4,9.7
to,9.7,9.8
travel,9.8,10.7
yeah,10.7,12.2
so,12.2,16.1
I,16.1,16.4
was,16.4,16.6
traveling,16.6,17.2
a,17.2,17.4
lot,17.4,18.1
this,18.1,18.3
last,18.3,19.7
minute,19.7,20.1
deal,20.1,20.8
in,20.8,20.9
one,20.9,21.1
of,21.1,21.2
the,21.2,21.3
web,21.3,21.6
sites,21.6,21.6
and,21.6,22.1
The,22.1,24.1
Weeknd,24.1,24.5
a,24.5,25.0
couple,25.0,25.3
of,25.3,25.4
weekends,25.4,25.7
ago,25.7,25.7
so,25.7,27.4
it,27.4,27.7
was,27.7,27.8
it,27.8,28.9
was,28.9,29.1
nice,29.1,29.4
I,29.4,29.5
was,29.5,29.8
already,29.8,30.0
planned,30.0,30.5
to,30.5,30.6
go,30.6,30.7
for,30.7,30.9
a,30.9,30.9
night,30.9,37.7
flight,37.7,38.2
pretty,38.2,38.5
much,38.5,38.6
I,38.6,38.7
think,38.7,38.8
the,38.8,39.0
last,39.0,39.2
flight,39.2,39.6
of,39.6,39.8
the,39.8,39.9
night,39.9,40.1
or,40.1,40.2
something,40.2,40.6
before,40.6,40.9
they,40.9,41.0
close,41.0,41.3
the,41.3,41.4
airport,41.4,41.8
so,41.8,42.9
expectable,42.9,48.5
play,48.5,49.0
early,49.0,50.7
and,50.7,51.5
realized,51.5,52.4
as,52.4,52.7
soon,52.7,52.8
as,52.8,52.9
I,52.9,53.0
reach,53.0,53.1
the,53.1,53.3
boarding,53.3,55.7
does,55.7,56.3
the,56.3,56.5
airport,56.5,56.9
was,56.9,57.2
full,57.2,57.5
of,57.5,57.7
people,57.7,58.0
that,58.0,58.3
cracking,58.3,58.9
he,58.9,59.1
was,59.1,59.3
like,59.3,59.5
this,59.5,59.7
all,59.9,61.9
the,61.9,62.0
flights,62.0,62.4
before,62.4,62.5
this,62.5,62.9
one,62.9,63.1
were,63.1,63.3
delayed,63.3,63.7
because,63.7,63.8
of,63.8,64.1
the,64.1,64.2
weather,64.2,64.5
so,64.5,64.7
somehow,64.7,67.9
I,67.9,68.5
rushed,68.5,69.1
through,69.1,69.2
things,69.2,69.8
to,69.8,70.0
security,70.0,70.7
and,70.7,70.7
everything,70.7,70.9
is,70.9,71.3
barely,71.3,71.9
managed,71.9,72.3
to,72.3,72.4
reach,72.4,73.1
the,73.1,73.2
boarding,73.2,73.6
gate,73.6,73.6
before,73.6,74.0
they,74.0,74.1
closed,74.1,74.4
it,74.4,74.6
I,74.6,75.8
think,75.8,75.9
it,75.9,76.0
was,76.0,76.1
five,76.1,76.8
minutes,76.8,76.9
left,76.9,77.3
before,77.3,77.5
I,77.5,77.7
could,77.7,77.9
even,77.9,78.0
enter,78.0,78.5
I,78.5,80.6
was,80.6,80.8
able,80.8,81.1
to,81.1,81.1
board,81.1,81.4
the,81.4,81.5
plane,81.5,81.6
and,83.3,83.9
I,83.9,84.0
know,84.0,84.1
these,84.1,84.4
are,84.4,84.6
some,84.6,85.1
of,85.1,85.2
these,85.2,85.3
flights,85.3,85.8
don't,85.8,86.0
have,86.0,86.3
like,86.3,86.8
the,86.8,86.9
bridge,86.9,87.2
to,87.2,87.4
the,87.4,87.5
to,87.5,88.0
the,88.0,88.1
plane,88.1,88.4
we,88.4,88.6
have,88.6,88.8
to,88.8,88.9
go,88.9,89.1
down,89.1,89.2
and,89.2,89.4
take,89.4,89.6
the,89.6,89.7
bus,89.7,89.9
and,89.9,90.2
the,90.2,90.3
bus,90.3,90.4
goes,90.4,90.9
I,90.9,91.0
hate,91.0,91.3
that,91.3,91.7
to,91.7,95.1
you,95.1,95.2
up,95.2,95.4
in,95.4,95.6
the,95.6,95.7
bus,95.7,96.0
and,96.0,96.3
then,96.3,96.4
you,96.4,96.6
have,96.6,96.8
to,96.8,96.9
wait,96.9,97.7
at,97.7,97.8
the,97.8,97.9
time,97.9,98.2
I,98.2,98.3
for,98.3,98.6
some,98.6,98.7
time,98.7,99.1
so,99.1,99.1
they,99.1,99.3
took,99.3,99.4
the,99.4,99.6
bus,99.6,100.0
on,100.0,100.1
to,100.1,100.3
the,100.3,100.4
plane,100.4,100.8
and,100.8,102.0
I,102.0,102.2
want,102.2,102.4
to,102.4,102.5
see,102.5,102.7
is,102.7,103.2
actually,103.2,103.4
this,103.4,103.7
really,103.7,104.1
small,104.1,104.7
propeller,104.7,105.3
plane,105.3,105.8
like,105.8,106.7
the,106.7,106.8
60,106.8,107.2
70,107.2,107.4
seat,107.4,107.9
or,107.9,108.1
something,108.1,108.5
which,108.5,110.3
I,110.3,110.4
hate,110.4,110.9
a,110.9,111.2
lot,111.2,111.4
because,111.4,111.7
I,111.7,111.9
don't,111.9,112.0
really,112.0,112.3
trust,112.3,112.5
the,112.5,112.8
propeller,112.8,113.3
planes,113.3,113.8
that,113.8,114.0
much,114.0,114.3
I,114.3,114.5
have,114.5,114.6
not,114.6,114.8
had,114.8,114.9
good,114.9,115.1
experiences,115.1,115.6
with,115.6,115.8
it,115.8,116.1
normally,116.1,118.1
I,118.1,118.3
only,118.3,118.5
take,118.5,118.9
pic,118.9,119.6
of,119.6,119.7
flies,119.7,120.0
with,120.0,120.2
the,120.2,120.3
with,120.3,120.7
the,120.7,120.8
Jet,120.8,121.1
Plane,121.1,121.5
so,121.5,121.6
that,121.6,121.7
but,121.7,124.9
I,124.9,125.0
didn't,125.0,125.2
have,125.2,125.3
an,125.3,125.4
option,125.4,125.6
here,125.6,125.9
because,125.9,126.2
I,126.2,126.3
didn't,126.3,126.8
even,126.8,126.9
see,126.9,127.2
which,127.2,127.4
player,127.4,127.8
was,127.8,128.1
just,128.1,128.2
got,128.2,128.7
this,128.7,128.9
deal,128.9,129.3
and,129.3,129.4
at,129.4,130.2
that,130.2,130.4
point,130.4,130.6
if,130.6,130.7
I'm,130.7,130.8
not,130.8,131.9
putting,131.9,132.4
any,132.4,132.6
more,132.6,132.7
because,132.7,133.0
I,133.0,133.2
was,133.2,133.4
right,133.4,133.5
outside,133.5,133.6
the,133.6,133.9
plane,133.9,134.3
because,134.3,137.0
they,137.0,137.3
were,137.3,137.4
getting,137.4,137.5
late,137.5,137.9
or,137.9,138.0
something,138.0,138.4
so,138.4,138.7
that,138.7,138.7
pretty,138.7,139.6
much,139.6,139.7
was,139.7,140.2
supposed,140.2,141.2
to,141.2,141.3
send,141.3,141.5
in,141.5,141.7
the,141.7,141.7
city,141.7,142.0
started,143.3,144.5
everything,144.5,145.4
we,145.4,146.0
sat,146.0,146.3
down,146.3,146.5
and,146.5,146.8
do,148.5,148.9
you,148.9,149.0
be,149.0,149.2
a,149.2,149.3
staff,149.3,149.8
was,149.8,150.0
not,150.0,150.1
very,150.1,150.4
polite,150.4,150.7
very,150.7,151.1
seldom,151.1,151.9
pushing,151.9,152.8
people,152.8,153.0
that,153.0,153.3
I'm,153.3,153.4
just,153.4,153.6
getting,153.6,153.8
them,153.8,154.0
seated,154.0,154.4
so,154.4,154.6
that,154.6,154.7
they,154.7,154.8
could,154.8,154.9
start,154.9,155.3
this,155.3,155.8
week,155.8,156.0
anyway,156.0,159.5
so,159.5,160.1
as,160.1,160.8
soon,160.8,161.0
as,161.0,161.1
we,161.1,161.5
are,161.5,161.5
ready,161.5,163.6
to,163.6,163.8
fly,163.8,164.2
there,164.2,164.4
was,164.4,164.5
a,164.5,164.6
last-minute,164.6,164.8
thing,164.8,165.1
that,165.1,165.4
take,165.4,167.3
off,167.3,167.5
take,167.5,173.0
off,173.0,173.1
and,173.1,174.3
can,174.3,174.4
imagine,174.4,174.5
we,174.5,174.8
stayed,174.8,175.0
at,175.0,175.2
the,175.2,175.2
timer,175.2,175.6
for,175.6,175.8
1,175.8,176.1
hour,176.1,176.2
waiting,176.2,177.0
for,177.0,177.1
the,177.1,177.2
plane,177.2,177.5
to,177.5,177.6
take,177.6,177.7
off,177.7,178.0
which,178.0,179.3
is,179.3,179.4
weird,179.4,179.7
because,179.7,179.8
I,179.8,180.1
was,180.1,180.5
just,180.5,180.6
wishing,180.6,181.1
the,181.1,181.3
same,181.3,181.4
to,181.4,181.7
start,181.7,182.2
and,182.2,182.4
now,182.4,182.5
we,182.5,182.7
have,182.7,182.9
to,182.9,182.9
sit,182.9,183.1
there,183.1,183.3
for,183.3,183.4
an,183.4,183.6
hour,183.6,183.9
and,183.9,184.4
it,184.4,184.7
was,184.7,184.9
like,184.9,185.4
you,185.4,185.6
know,185.6,185.7
they,185.7,185.8
don't,185.8,185.9
even,185.9,186.1
switch,186.1,186.2
on,186.2,186.4

call,196.8,196.9
for,196.9,197.0
those,197.0,197.2
not,197.2,197.7
tell,197.7,197.9
Paris,197.9,198.4
Texas,198.4,198.7
waving,198.7,199.2
thing,199.2,199.4
that,199.4,199.7
happened,199.7,200.2
and,200.2,200.9
where,200.9,201.1
is,201.1,201.3
this,201.3,201.5
cruising,201.5,202.0
altitude,202.0,202.7
everything,202.7,203.4
seems,203.4,203.6
to,203.6,203.7
be,203.7,203.7
fine,203.7,204.0
you,204.0,204.1
know,204.1,204.2
as,204.2,204.4
soon,204.4,204.5
as,204.5,204.6
it,204.6,204.8
reaches,204.8,205.1
cruising,205.1,205.5
you,205.5,205.6
remove,205.6,205.9
a,205.9,206.0
seat,206.0,206.2
belt,206.2,206.3
they,208.8,209.2
said,209.2,209.4
we,209.4,209.5
couldn't,209.5,209.8
because,209.8,210.1
the,210.1,210.4
roads,210.4,210.6
are,210.6,210.6
terrible,210.6,210.9
and,210.9,211.2
suicune,211.2,211.9
take,211.9,212.2
off,212.2,212.3
a,212.3,212.4
seat,212.4,212.7
belts,212.7,213.1
calories,213.1,213.7

not,213.8,213.9
allowed,213.9,214.2
to,214.2,214.3
be,214.3,214.4
used,214.4,214.5
we,214.5,214.8
can,214.8,215.0
go,215.0,215.2
there,215.2,215.5
on,215.5,216.2
the,216.2,216.3
plane,216.3,216.6
was,216.6,216.7
literally,216.7,217.0
shaking,217.0,217.2
left,217.2,217.7
to,217.7,217.8
right,217.8,218.0
because,218.0,218.8
of,218.8,219.0
the,219.0,219.5
table,219.5,219.8
and,219.8,220.0

all,220.8,221.0
my,221.0,221.3
worst,221.3,221.7

about,222.4,222.6
a,222.6,223.5

go,225.0,227.0
well,227.0,227.5
in,227.5,229.5
the,229.5,229.6

go,230.0,230.1
off,230.1,230.2

in,236.4,236.6
out,236.6,237.3
of,237.3,237.4
a,237.4,237.5
horror,237.5,237.8
movie,237.8,238.1
or,238.1,238.1
something,238.1,238.6
and,238.6,239.7
sometimes,239.7,243.3
I,243.3,243.5
think,243.5,244.9
before,244.9,245.3
leaving,245.3,245.7
the,245.7,245.8
Lord,245.8,246.1
and,246.1,246.3
getting,246.3,246.5
up,246.5,246.6
and,246.6,246.8
falling,246.8,247.0
but,247.0,247.9
this,247.9,248.0
was,248.0,248.2
weird,248.2,248.4
because,248.4,248.6
I'm,248.6,249.1
falling,249.1,249.6
for,249.6,249.8
like,249.8,250.1
seconds,250.1,250.5
like,250.5,250.7
10-15,250.7,251.2
seconds,251.2,251.6
because,251.6,252.0
this,252.0,252.3
fall,252.3,252.8
and,252.8,253.9
I'm,253.9,254.4
pretty,254.4,255.1
glossophobia,255.1,255.8
can,255.8,256.3
I,256.3,256.4
don't,256.4,256.9
like,256.9,257.1
that,257.1,257.3
cold,257.3,257.7
environment,257.7,257.9
and,257.9,258.7
this,258.7,259.5
is,259.5,259.7
getting,259.7,259.9
even,259.9,260.3
worse,260.3,260.4
for,260.4,260.7
me,260.7,260.8
and,260.8,263.0
then,263.0,263.3
to,263.3,263.6
make,263.6,263.7
matters,263.7,264.0
even,264.0,264.5
worse,264.5,264.7
the,264.7,265.3
oxygen,265.3,265.8
masks,265.8,266.2
drop,266.2,266.3
read,268.8,269.1
anyway,269.1,269.5
and,269.5,269.9
this,269.9,270.4
is,270.4,270.5
the,270.5,270.6
first,270.6,270.7
time,270.7,271.0
I'm,271.0,271.3
experiencing,271.3,271.8
oxygen,271.8,272.3
mask,272.3,272.7
and,272.7,272.8
I,272.8,272.9
don't,272.9,273.0
know,273.0,273.1
how,273.1,273.2
to,273.2,273.4
use,273.4,273.5
it,273.5,273.8
or,273.8,274.0
do,274.0,274.2
they,274.2,274.3
tell,274.3,274.5
it,274.5,274.6
every,274.6,274.8
time,274.8,274.9
but,274.9,275.1
it's,275.1,275.3
very,275.3,275.3
difficult,275.3,275.4
when,275.4,275.8
it,275.8,276.0
happens,276.0,276.3
to,276.3,276.4
you,276.4,276.5
somehow,276.5,277.4
the,277.4,277.6
guy,277.6,277.8
sitting,277.8,278.1
next,278.1,278.2

me,278.8,278.9
put,278.9,279.1
it,279.1,279.2
on,279.2,279.3
so,279.3,279.6
I,279.6,279.7
can,279.7,279.8
breathe,279.8,280.2
again,280.2,280.2
but,280.2,281.5
it,281.5,281.6
was,281.6,281.7
handling,281.7,282.2
experience,282.2,282.6
we,282.6,283.1
always,283.1,283.4
scared,283.4,284.0
the,284.0,284.1
plane,284.1,284.3
is,284.3,284.4
going,284.4,284.5
up,284.5,284.8
and,284.8,285.0
down,285.0,285.1
and,285.1,285.6
it,285.6,285.9
was,285.9,286.1
just,286.1,286.3
the,286.3,286.8
lights,286.8,287.1
were,287.1,287.2
off,287.2,287.5
and,287.5,287.8
we,287.8,289.5
could,289.5,289.6
eat,289.6,289.9
at,289.9,290.1
their,290.1,290.2

also,290.8,291.0
pretty,291.0,291.2
scared,291.2,291.7
of,291.7,291.7
what,291.7,291.9
happening,291.9,292.7
and,292.7,293.7
I,293.7,293.7
feel,293.7,294.0
like,294.0,294.1
I,294.1,294.3
think,294.3,294.5
20,294.5,294.9
minutes,294.9,294.9
of,294.9,295.3

experience,296.4,297.1
going,297.1,297.3
up,297.3,297.5
and,297.5,297.7
down,297.7,297.8
the,297.8,298.2
plane,298.2,298.4
can,298.4,298.6
stabilize,298.6,299.3
your,299.3,299.9
ass,299.9,300.1
to,300.1,300.3
remove,300.3,300.6
a,300.6,300.7
master,300.7,301.2
light,301.2,301.4
came,301.4,301.7
on,301.7,301.8
again,301.8,302.1
everybody,302.1,303.7
was,303.7,304.0
completely,304.0,304.4
shaken,304.4,304.8
they,304.8,307.1
were,307.1,307.2
fighting,307.2,307.6
with,307.6,307.8
the,307.8,307.9
ass.,307.9,308.4
Off,308.4,308.6
and,308.6,308.7
won't,308.7,310.6
do,310.6,310.6
anything,310.6,310.7
but,310.7,311.1
no,311.1,311.4
experience,311.4,313.4
so,313.4,316.2
they,316.2,316.3
started,316.3,316.6
the,316.6,316.8
10,316.8,317.2
DVD,317.2,317.6
The,317.6,318.0
Landing,318.0,318.5
was,318.5,318.7
first,318.7,319.7
performed,319.7,319.9
on,319.9,320.3
to,320.3,320.5
the,320.5,320.7
runway,320.7,321.7
twice,321.7,322.3
before,322.3,322.5
we,322.5,322.7
landed,322.7,323.1
I,323.1,324.0
don't,324.0,324.2
know,324.2,324.3
what,324.3,324.5
the,324.5,324.6
hell,324.6,324.8
is,324.8,324.9
going,324.9,325.0
on,325.0,325.4
it,326.2,326.6
put,326.6,326.9
me,326.9,327.0

travel,327.8,328.1
so,328.1,328.3
much,328.3,328.4
that,328.4,328.7
I,328.7,328.8
cancel,328.8,329.2
my,329.2,329.4
flight,329.4,329.5

to,330.9,331.0
fly,331.0,331.2
again,331.2,331.4
because,331.4,332.5
I,332.5,332.5
believe,332.5,333.1
it,333.1,333.2
was,333.2,333.3
a,333.3,333.4
similar,333.4,333.7
flight,333.7,334.1
I,334.1,334.8

but,337.3,337.6
well,337.6,337.9
I'm,337.9,338.5
sitting,338.5,338.7
in,338.7,339.2
my,339.2,339.3
head,339.3,339.5
and,339.5,340.7
I,340.7,340.9
thought,340.9,341.1
to,341.1,341.4
myself,341.4,341.5
I'm,341.5,342.0
never,342.0,342.3
going,342.3,342.5
to,342.5,342.5
take,342.5,342.7

a,343.4,343.6
Night,343.6,343.8
Flight,343.8,344.1
again,344.1,344.3
especially,344.3,344.5
when,344.5,345.0
I,345.0,345.0
know,345.0,345.1
this,345.1,345.3
is,345.3,345.4
a,345.4,345.5
small,345.5,345.7
propeller,345.7,346.1
plane,346.1,346.3
just,346.3,347.0
put,347.0,347.2
me,347.2,347.3
off,347.3,347.4
this,347.4,347.6
propeller,347.6,348.0
planes,348.0,348.6
forever,348.6,349.0
I,349.0,349.1
don't,349.1,349.3
think,349.3,349.6
what,350.5,351.0
you,351.0,351.1
fly,351.1,351.3
with,351.3,351.6
these,351.6,352.1
planes,352.1,352.5
ever,352.5,352.6
in,352.6,352.9
my,352.9,353.0
life,353.0,353.3
