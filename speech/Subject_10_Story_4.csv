fine,39.6,39.9
for,39.9,40.0
me,40.0,40.1

going,41.2,41.5

because,67.4,67.8
of,67.8,68.1
the,68.1,68.2

the,73.7,73.8

those,132.2,132.6
planes,132.6,133.0
leave,133.0,133.2
something,133.2,133.6

1,151.0,151.2
hour,151.2,151.4
because,151.4,156.1
I,156.1,156.4

sit,177.1,177.3
down,177.3,177.5

then,178.4,178.6
he,178.6,178.8
knows,178.8,179.2
that,179.2,179.3
well,179.3,179.9
the,179.9,180.6
traffic,180.6,181.0
controllers,181.0,181.5
told,181.5,181.8
us,181.8,181.9

we,182.0,182.1
can't,182.1,182.4

the,183.4,184.4
weather,184.4,184.7
is,184.7,184.8
too,184.8,184.9
bad,184.9,185.0

I,191.8,191.8
was,191.8,192.3
thinking,192.3,192.4
why,192.4,192.8

so,200.7,200.8
rude,200.8,200.9
they,200.9,203.1
obviously,203.1,203.4
didn't,203.4,203.6
have,203.6,203.8
any,203.8,204.1

at,214.9,215.2
the,215.2,215.3
time,215.3,215.6
I,215.6,215.8

were,223.1,223.6
cranky,223.6,223.9
and,223.9,224.3
they,224.3,224.5
don't,224.5,224.6
even,224.6,224.7

conditioning,225.4,225.8
or,225.8,226.0
something,226.0,226.3
why,226.3,226.4
was,226.4,226.6
it,226.6,226.8
again,226.8,227.1
and,227.1,227.4
it,227.4,227.5
was,227.5,227.6
a,227.6,227.7
small,227.7,228.6
crampy,228.6,229.1
plays,229.1,229.6
with,229.6,229.8
them,229.8,230.2
two,230.2,230.3
people,230.3,230.7
sitting,230.7,230.8
right,230.8,231.1
next,231.1,231.2
to,231.2,231.4
each,231.4,231.5
other,231.5,231.7
and,231.7,233.6
I'm,233.6,233.9
really,233.9,234.4
getting,234.4,234.6
really,234.6,235.0
panicky,235.0,235.4
and,235.4,235.6
fidgety,235.6,236.1
weather,236.1,236.4
in,236.4,246.8
the,246.8,246.9
boarding,246.9,247.3
gate,247.3,247.3
was,247.3,247.6
still,247.6,247.7
open,247.7,248.0
to,248.0,248.4
it,248.4,248.5
was,248.5,248.6
okay,248.6,249.3
but,249.3,249.4
it,249.4,249.5
was,249.5,249.6
still,249.6,250.3
not,250.3,250.6
the,250.6,250.7
perfect,250.7,251.0
situation,251.0,251.2
anyhow,251.2,252.8
after,252.8,253.1
that,253.1,253.3
one,253.3,253.5
hour,253.5,253.7
we,253.7,254.0
would,254.0,254.7
run,254.7,255.0
away,255.0,255.1
and,255.1,255.4
we,255.4,255.5
take,255.5,255.7
off,255.7,255.9
take,255.9,256.8
off,256.8,256.9
is,256.9,257.1
also,257.1,257.2
shaky,257.2,257.8
batting,257.8,258.2
is,258.2,258.3
the,258.3,258.4
winds,258.4,258.7
were,258.7,258.8
too,258.8,258.9
strong,258.9,259.1
for,259.1,259.4
the,259.4,259.5
plane,259.5,259.7
the,259.7,259.9
plane,259.9,259.9
is,259.9,260.2
really,260.2,260.4
small,260.4,260.6
so,260.6,262.5
I,262.5,262.6
was,262.6,262.7
just,262.7,262.8
going,262.8,263.0
up,263.0,263.3
and,263.3,263.4
down,263.4,263.5
and,263.5,263.9
by,263.9,264.0
the,264.0,264.1
time,264.1,264.1
we,264.1,264.4
reached,264.4,264.4
e,264.4,264.9
at,264.9,265.1
the,265.1,265.2
cruising,265.2,266.2
altitude,266.2,266.5
we,266.5,267.0
think,267.0,267.4
we,267.4,267.5
can,267.5,267.7
take,267.7,267.9
off,267.9,268.0
the,268.0,268.2
seatbelt,268.2,268.4
law,268.4,268.6
go,268.6,268.7
to,268.7,268.9
do,268.9,269.5
something,269.5,269.8
but,269.8,271.6
they,271.6,271.7
said,271.7,271.9
you,271.9,272.0
can,272.0,272.2
take,272.2,272.4
off,272.4,272.5
the,272.5,272.7
seatbelt,272.7,272.9
because,272.9,273.5
the,273.5,273.6
plane,273.6,273.9
was,273.9,273.9
going,273.9,274.3
from,274.3,274.4
left,274.4,274.6
to,274.6,274.8
right,274.8,274.9
is,274.9,276.1
to,276.1,277.4
be,277.4,277.6
used,277.6,277.7
so,277.7,277.9
we,277.9,278.1
didn't,278.1,278.3
see,278.3,278.5
nobody,278.5,278.9
could,278.9,279.2
go,279.2,279.4
to,279.4,279.5
love,279.5,279.7
me,279.7,280.0
it,280.0,280.8
was,280.8,281.0
like,281.0,281.1
everything,281.1,281.9
was,281.9,282.3
going,282.3,282.5
wrong,282.5,282.8
in,282.8,283.0
there,283.0,283.2
and,283.2,283.5
that,283.5,283.7
experience,283.7,284.2
a,284.2,284.2
and,284.2,285.4
then,285.4,285.5
it,285.5,285.6
gets,285.6,285.9
worse,285.9,286.2
the,286.2,287.4
lights,287.4,287.8
go,287.8,287.9
off,287.9,288.0
and,288.0,294.1
it's,294.1,294.8
lightning,294.8,295.1
outside,295.1,295.5
because,295.5,295.9
it,295.9,296.1
was,296.1,296.3
raining,296.3,296.4
flashes,296.4,298.0
of,298.0,298.1
light,298.1,298.4
coming,298.4,298.7
in,298.7,299.0
like,299.0,299.3
a,299.3,299.3
picture,299.3,299.7
from,299.7,299.9
a,299.9,300.2

from,301.3,301.4
horror,301.4,301.7
movie,301.7,302.2
exactly,302.2,303.9
you've,303.9,306.6
been,306.6,306.8
told,306.8,306.9
not,306.9,307.2
to,307.2,307.3
get,307.3,307.5
up,307.5,307.8
you,307.8,308.0
can,308.0,308.0
go,308.0,308.3
to,308.3,308.4
the,308.4,308.5
library,308.5,308.6
in,308.6,309.0
the,309.0,309.1
plane,309.1,309.4
is,309.4,309.6
just,309.6,309.7
shaking,309.7,310.2
terribly,310.2,310.7
this,310.7,313.5
happens,313.5,313.9
if,313.9,314.0
you,314.0,314.0
fall,314.0,315.8
and,315.8,316.1
you,316.1,316.2
feel,316.2,316.5
like,316.5,316.5
it's,316.5,316.9
going,316.9,317.1
to,317.1,317.1
fall,317.1,317.2
out.,317.2,318.9
Only,318.9,319.1
stayed,319.1,319.4
for,319.4,319.5
one,319.5,319.6
or,319.6,319.8
two,319.8,319.9
seconds,319.9,320.2
late,320.2,320.5
but,320.5,320.7
just,320.7,320.7
like,320.7,321.0
30,321.0,321.4
seconds.,321.4,321.8
Just,321.8,321.9
falling,321.9,322.4
it,322.4,322.7
felt,322.7,323.0
like,323.0,323.1
the,323.1,323.3
plane,323.3,323.5
fell,323.5,323.9
like,323.9,324.2
400,324.2,324.7
feet,324.7,325.0
or,325.0,325.1
something,325.1,325.4
and,325.4,326.5
I'm,326.5,326.8
busted,326.8,330.8
I,330.8,330.8
can,330.8,331.0
imagine,331.0,331.3
about,331.3,331.5
describe,331.5,332.0
experience,332.0,332.4
getting,332.4,332.7
is,332.7,333.1
coming,333.1,333.2
through,333.2,333.6
the,333.6,334.4
worst,334.4,334.8
and,336.5,337.0
then,337.0,337.3
the,337.3,337.8
oxygen,337.8,338.2
mask,338.2,338.5
for,338.5,338.9
happened,338.9,348.8
to,348.8,348.9
me,348.9,349.0
okay,349.0,349.6
and,349.6,350.1
I,350.1,350.2
don't,350.2,350.4
know,350.4,350.5
what,350.5,350.6
to,350.6,350.7
do,350.7,350.8
with,350.8,351.0
it,351.0,351.1
because,351.1,351.4
I,351.4,351.6
could,351.6,351.9
not,351.9,352.0
put,352.0,352.2
it,352.2,352.3
on,352.3,352.5
because,352.5,353.1
I,353.1,353.3
was,353.3,353.4
panicking,353.4,353.9
and,353.9,354.2
then,354.2,354.3
was,354.3,354.8
shaking,354.8,355.3
the,355.3,356.4
guy,356.4,356.6
sitting,356.6,356.8
next,356.8,356.9
to,356.9,357.1
me,357.1,357.3
actually,357.3,357.4
help,357.4,357.7
me,357.7,357.8
put,357.8,358.0
on,358.0,358.1
the,358.1,358.2
mask,358.2,358.6
so,358.6,358.7
I,358.7,358.8
could,358.8,358.9
breathe,358.9,359.1
again,359.1,359.3
but,359.3,360.3
then,360.3,360.4
again,360.4,360.7
to,360.7,360.9
spin,360.9,361.1
once,361.1,361.4
again,361.4,361.6
falling,361.6,362.3
and,362.3,362.5
then,362.5,362.6
trying,362.6,362.9
to,362.9,363.0
climb,363.0,363.2
up,363.2,363.6
falling,363.6,364.5

to,364.8,364.9
climb,364.9,365.1
up,365.1,365.3
and,366.5,366.9
I,366.9,367.0
was,367.0,367.6
thinking,367.6,367.7
okay,367.7,368.1
this,368.1,368.5
is,368.5,368.7
the,368.7,368.8
last,368.8,368.9
flight,368.9,369.3
of,369.3,369.5
my,369.5,369.7

this,371.7,372.5
is,372.5,372.7
going,372.7,372.9
to,372.9,372.9
crash,372.9,373.3
and,373.3,373.5
everything,373.5,373.8
is,373.8,373.9
going,373.9,374.0
to,374.0,374.1
be,374.1,374.2
the,374.2,374.8

of,383.4,383.4
the,383.4,383.6
definition,383.6,391.1
of,391.1,391.9
when,391.9,392.1
everybody,392.1,392.4
was,392.4,392.7
annoyed,392.7,393.0
with,393.0,393.1
the,393.1,393.2
flu,393.2,393.4
so,393.4,393.6
we,393.6,393.8
told,393.8,394.3
her,394.3,394.4
we,394.4,394.5
can,394.5,394.7
take,394.7,394.8
off,394.8,394.9
the,394.9,395.1

everybody,400.2,400.5
was,400.5,400.8
shouting,400.8,401.1
at,401.1,401.2
the,401.2,401.3
proof,401.3,401.8

of,406.4,406.6
an,406.6,406.7

I,407.2,407.3
really,407.3,407.4
really,407.4,407.9
scary,407.9,408.3
then,409.0,410.0
we,410.0,410.2
started,410.2,410.3
to,410.3,410.7
send,410.7,410.9

do,421.1,421.2
something,421.2,421.6
describing,421.6,422.5
the,422.5,422.6
next,422.6,422.9
thing,422.9,423.0
I,423.0,423.2

the,423.3,423.6
next,423.6,423.7
best,423.7,424.0
thing,424.0,424.2
would,424.2,424.4
