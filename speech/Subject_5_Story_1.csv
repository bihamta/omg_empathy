pretty,276.4,278.2
painful,278.2,278.5
but,278.5,279.0
that,279.0,279.4
comes,279.4,285.3
with,285.3,285.4
a,285.4,285.8
stupid,285.8,287.1

to,287.3,287.4
do,287.4,287.5
you,295.3,295.5
also,295.5,295.8
that,295.8,296.0

one,296.3,296.4
of,296.4,296.4
those,296.4,296.5
experiences.,296.5,297.3
It's,297.3,297.8

but,310.4,311.4
it,311.4,311.8
was,311.8,311.9
weird,311.9,312.0
because,312.0,312.3
it,312.3,316.1
was,316.1,319.5
essentially,319.5,320.6
which,320.6,321.3
was,321.3,321.5
really,321.5,321.6
bad,321.6,321.9
because,321.9,322.0
I,322.0,322.2

we,324.0,324.1
will,324.1,324.2
spend,324.2,324.4
a,324.4,324.5
lot,324.5,324.6
of,324.6,324.7
time,324.7,324.8
together,324.8,325.1
and,325.1,325.7
then,325.7,326.3
like,326.3,326.6
just,326.6,327.3
like,327.3,327.4
none,327.4,328.1
movies,328.1,328.6
like,328.6,328.9
I,328.9,329.0
was,329.0,329.1
like,329.1,329.3
I,329.3,329.4
was,329.4,331.2
a,331.2,331.5
bit,331.5,331.7
stressed,331.7,332.1
out,332.1,332.2
and,332.2,332.4
depressed,332.4,332.5
by,332.5,333.0
"this,",333.0,333.4
cuz,333.4,333.5
my,333.5,333.5
first,333.5,333.7
real,333.7,333.9
friend,333.9,334.0
was,334.0,334.3
moving,334.3,334.5
times,334.5,335.1
that,335.1,335.4
was,335.4,335.6
really,335.6,335.8
can't,335.8,343.7
keep,343.7,343.8
in,343.8,343.9
touch,343.9,344.1
cuz,344.1,344.3
it,344.3,344.4
was,344.4,344.4
a,344.4,344.5
bit,344.5,344.6
before,344.6,344.8
like,344.8,345.2
social,345.2,345.6
media,345.6,345.8
and,345.8,345.9
stuff,345.9,346.1
so,346.1,346.3
we,346.3,346.3
swapped,346.3,346.5
self,346.5,346.8
and,346.8,347.0
I'm,347.0,347.1
just,347.1,347.2
trying,347.2,347.4
to,347.4,347.4
keep,347.4,347.6
in,347.6,347.7
touch,347.7,347.7
like,347.7,348.2
I,348.2,348.5
called,348.5,349.0
her,349.0,349.1
while,349.1,349.2
she,349.2,349.4
couldn't,349.4,350.0
get,350.0,350.1
in,350.1,350.2
touch,350.2,350.3
with,350.3,350.5
her,350.5,350.7
dad,350.7,350.9
is,350.9,352.9
going,352.9,353.1
to,353.1,353.2
be,353.2,353.4
kind,353.4,353.7
of,353.7,353.9
turn,355.3,355.6
key,355.6,355.7
switch,355.7,355.9
SIM,355.9,356.3
cards,356.3,356.4
at,356.4,356.6
work,356.6,356.8
so,356.8,356.9
well,356.9,357.1
in,357.1,357.2
China,357.2,357.6
so,357.6,357.8
we,357.8,357.8
couldn't,357.8,358.0
get,358.0,358.2
in,358.2,359.3
touch,359.3,359.4
with,359.4,359.7
each,359.7,359.7
other,359.7,359.9
again,359.9,360.1
so,360.1,360.5
we,360.5,361.0
kind,361.0,361.2
of,361.2,361.3
dropped,361.3,361.5
out,361.5,361.7
of,361.7,361.7
contact,361.7,362.2
for,362.2,362.2
a,362.2,362.3
while,362.3,362.4
which,362.4,362.6
was,362.6,362.8
it,362.8,363.4
was,363.4,363.5
a,363.5,363.6
