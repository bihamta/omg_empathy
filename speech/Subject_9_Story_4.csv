don't,39.0,39.2
like,39.2,39.4
to,39.4,39.5
spend,39.5,39.8
anymore,39.8,40.1
but,40.1,40.7
some,40.7,40.8
noise,40.8,41.1
the,41.1,41.2
airplane,41.2,41.7
and,41.7,43.0
I,43.0,48.0
took,48.0,48.2
this,48.2,48.4
cheap,48.4,49.5
flight,49.5,49.8
I,49.8,49.9
found,49.9,50.0

the,53.6,53.8
Night,53.8,54.2
Flight,54.2,54.6

like,57.1,57.3
9:30,57.3,58.1
p.m.,58.1,58.3
or,58.3,58.4
10,58.4,58.6
p.m.,58.6,58.7
in,58.7,59.0
the,59.0,59.1

cheap,59.9,60.3
metal,60.3,60.6
trellis,60.6,60.6
1,60.6,61.1
hour,61.1,61.4
shouldn't,61.4,61.8
be,61.8,61.9
that,61.9,62.1
much,62.1,62.3
of,62.3,62.4
a,62.4,62.4
problem,62.4,62.5
there,62.5,64.7
for,64.7,65.0
a,65.0,65.0
couple,65.0,65.2
of,65.2,65.3
hours,65.3,65.4
before,65.4,65.9
the,65.9,66.2
boarding,66.2,66.6
time,66.6,66.9
it,66.9,68.1
was,68.1,68.3
like,68.3,68.6
a,68.6,68.7
rainy,68.7,69.0
night,69.0,69.2
like,69.2,69.6
regular,69.6,70.1
raining,70.1,70.5
windy,70.5,71.1
head,71.1,71.3
of,71.3,71.5
an,71.5,71.6
evening,71.6,71.7
and,71.7,73.1
when,73.1,73.2
I,73.2,73.3
reach,73.3,73.5
the,73.5,73.6
airport,73.6,73.8
I,73.8,74.1
see,74.1,74.3
well,74.3,74.6
it's,74.6,74.9
jam-packed,74.9,77.1
do,77.1,77.4
people,77.4,77.9
in,77.9,78.0
Brazil,78.0,78.2
Hughes,78.2,78.7
Q4,78.7,79.3
check-in,79.3,79.7
apparently,79.7,81.6
all,81.6,81.7
the,81.7,81.8
flights,81.8,82.2
before,82.2,82.4
mine,82.4,82.9
were,82.9,83.1
delayed,83.1,83.6
because,83.6,83.7
of,83.7,83.9
the,83.9,84.1
weather,84.1,84.3
in,84.3,84.9
so,84.9,85.5
they,85.5,85.7
would,85.7,85.8
be,85.8,86.0
so,86.0,86.2
many,86.2,86.3
people,86.3,86.4
at,86.4,86.8
the,86.8,86.9
Airport,86.9,87.1

to,88.8,89.1
security,89.1,89.7
Q,89.7,90.0
everything,90.0,90.3
was,90.3,90.6
completely,90.6,91.2
full,91.2,91.7
and,91.7,92.0
there's,92.0,92.4
so,92.4,92.6
many,92.6,92.7
people,92.7,92.9
that,92.9,93.1
somehow,93.1,94.6
I,94.6,94.9
barely,94.9,95.4
managed,95.4,95.8
to,95.8,95.9
beat,95.9,96.2
the,96.2,96.4
boarding,96.4,96.7
gate,96.7,96.8
in,96.8,97.4
in,97.4,97.6
time,97.6,97.9
so,97.9,98.1
that,98.1,98.2
I,98.2,98.6
could,98.6,98.9
vote,98.9,98.9
before,98.9,99.3
they,99.3,99.5
close,99.5,99.9
it,99.9,100.1
even,100.1,101.3
though,101.3,101.6
at,101.6,101.7
least,101.7,101.8
2,101.8,102.3
hours,102.3,102.4
before,102.4,102.7
I,102.7,103.2
could,103.2,103.5
before,103.5,103.8
I,103.8,104.0
had,104.0,104.1
to,104.1,104.3
do,104.3,104.5
this,104.5,104.7
but,104.7,104.9
the,104.9,105.4
whole,105.4,105.6
Rush,105.6,105.8
was,105.8,106.1
just,106.1,106.3
too,106.3,106.4
much,106.4,106.5
for,106.5,106.7
me,106.7,106.8
to,106.8,106.9
management,106.9,107.9
and,107.9,109.0
Aditya,109.0,109.7
boarding,109.7,110.2
do,110.2,110.3
not,110.3,110.5
too,110.5,110.6
happy,110.6,110.9
to,110.9,111.0
let,111.0,111.2
me,111.2,111.3
in,111.3,111.4
because,111.4,111.5
I,111.5,111.9
was,111.9,112.0
just,112.0,112.4
on,112.4,112.7
time,112.7,113.0
and,113.0,113.1
beat,113.1,113.3
me,113.3,113.4
with,113.4,113.5
late,113.5,114.0
but,114.0,114.9
they,114.9,115.0
allowed,115.0,115.2
me,115.2,115.3
to,115.3,115.4
board,115.4,115.8
you,117.1,117.4
know,117.4,117.5
what,117.5,117.6
some,117.6,117.9
of,117.9,118.0
these,118.0,118.2
flights,118.2,118.6
don't,118.6,118.9
have,118.9,119.1
these,119.1,119.2
bridge,119.2,119.7

the,120.3,120.4
flight,120.4,120.7
and,120.7,120.7
have,120.7,120.9
to,120.9,121.0
go,121.0,121.2
down,121.2,121.5

to,122.2,122.8
the,122.8,123.5
flight,123.5,123.8
I,123.8,124.0
don't,124.0,124.3
like,124.3,124.5
that,124.5,124.6
thing,124.6,124.8
it's,124.8,125.3
like,125.3,125.5
putting,125.5,126.1
sheep,126.1,126.6
and,126.6,126.8
in,126.8,127.0
a,127.0,127.0

letting,127.5,127.8
them,127.8,127.9
go,127.9,128.2
so,128.2,129.2
you,129.2,129.3
didn't,129.3,129.6
pay,129.6,129.8

the,141.3,141.5
plane,141.5,141.9
and,141.9,142.0
then,142.0,142.1
I,142.1,142.2
see,142.2,142.4
this,142.4,142.6
is,142.6,142.8
the,142.8,142.9
small,142.9,143.6
