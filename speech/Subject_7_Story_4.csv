drivers,8.5,8.9
don't,8.9,9.2
want,9.2,9.6
no,9.6,10.8
it,10.8,11.1
depends,11.1,11.5
on,11.5,11.7
whether,11.7,12.0
we,12.0,12.1
are,12.1,12.2
landing,12.2,12.8
hamburger,12.8,13.5
not,13.5,13.9
fun,13.9,17.1
yeah,17.1,18.8
I,18.8,18.9
had,18.9,19.1
a,19.1,19.1
similar,19.1,19.3
experience,19.3,19.5
but,19.5,20.1
not,20.1,20.3
lending,20.3,20.8
good,20.8,20.9
going,20.9,21.2
away,21.2,21.3
a,21.3,21.5
couple,21.5,22.8
of,22.8,22.9
weeks,22.9,23.2
ago,23.2,23.3
I,23.3,23.8
had,23.8,23.9
to,23.9,24.1
go,24.1,24.2
to,24.2,24.4
Versailles,24.4,24.8
for,24.8,25.1
the,25.1,25.2
holiday,25.2,25.6
and,25.6,25.7
I,25.7,26.6
was,26.6,26.8
looking,26.8,27.0
at,27.0,27.2
Ray,27.2,27.6
and,27.6,27.7
it,27.7,27.9
used,27.9,28.1
to,28.1,28.1
take,28.1,28.3
Lord,28.3,28.7
takes,28.7,29.1
long,29.1,29.3
time,29.3,29.5
to,29.5,29.7
go,29.7,29.9
by,29.9,30.0
train,30.0,30.2
so,30.2,30.5
I,30.5,30.6
thought,30.6,30.8
I,30.8,31.0
might,31.0,31.0
take,31.0,31.7
off,31.7,31.8
lights,31.8,32.2
to,32.2,32.4
normal,32.4,32.6
expensive,32.6,33.4
to,33.4,33.9
run,33.9,34.0
one,34.0,34.3
of,34.3,34.4
these,34.4,34.6
last,34.6,34.9
minute,34.9,35.1
deals,35.1,35.7
website,35.7,36.6
I,36.6,36.7
found,36.7,36.7
this,36.7,37.0
really,37.0,37.2
cheap,37.2,37.5
flight,37.5,37.9
is,37.9,38.4
that,38.4,38.5
good,38.5,38.8
used,38.8,39.2
so,39.2,40.2
I,40.2,40.3
took,40.3,40.4
that,40.4,40.6
one,40.6,40.7
too,40.7,43.0
late,43.0,43.1
in,43.1,43.3
the,43.3,43.4
evening,43.4,43.8
can,43.8,44.0
a,44.0,44.2
fight,44.2,44.4
almost,44.4,44.6
like,44.6,44.9
the,44.9,45.0
last,45.0,45.2
one,45.2,45.5
of,45.5,45.9
the,45.9,46.1
day,46.1,46.2
so,46.2,47.6
but,47.6,47.9
I,47.9,48.0
reached,48.0,48.2
the,48.2,48.4
airport,48.4,48.6
it,48.6,48.9
was,48.9,49.1
rainy,49.1,49.7
and,49.7,49.9
windy,49.9,50.6
so,50.6,51.0
I,51.0,51.1
thought,51.1,51.2
well,51.2,51.5
that,51.5,51.7
might,51.7,51.9
be,51.9,52.0
place,52.0,52.3
where,52.3,52.5
I,52.5,52.6
went,52.6,53.0
to,53.0,53.2
bed,53.2,53.3
early,53.3,53.4
a,53.4,54.2
couple,54.2,54.3
of,54.3,54.5
hours,54.5,54.7
early,54.7,55.0
actually,55.0,55.4
and,55.4,56.3
where,56.3,56.6
is,56.6,56.9
there,56.9,57.1
there,57.1,57.6
was,57.6,57.7
a,57.7,57.8
huge,57.8,58.1
huge,58.1,58.4
Q4,58.4,59.0

apparently,59.4,60.7
all,60.7,61.7
the,61.7,61.8

before,62.3,62.4
ours,62.4,63.4
were,63.4,63.7
delayed,63.7,64.0
because,64.0,64.2
of,64.2,64.5
the,64.5,64.6
weather,64.6,64.9
and,64.9,65.7
there,65.7,66.1
was,66.1,66.1
a,66.1,66.2
huge,66.2,66.2
chicken,66.6,67.1
Cuban,67.1,67.7
toast,67.7,68.2

at,69.8,70.0
the,70.0,70.1
airport,70.1,70.2
and,70.2,70.5
not,70.5,70.6
normally,70.6,71.0
that,71.0,71.0
goes,71.0,71.4
many,71.4,71.5
people,71.5,71.9
have,71.9,71.9
this,71.9,73.9
early,73.9,74.9
I,74.9,75.2
could,75.2,75.4
barely,75.4,75.8
manage,75.8,76.2

get,76.4,76.5

in,78.0,78.4
the,78.4,78.5
security,78.5,79.0
is,79.0,79.4
just,79.4,79.7
too,79.7,80.2
many,80.2,80.4
people,80.4,80.5
and,80.5,81.1

have,81.4,81.7

to,82.1,82.2
handle,82.2,82.5
this,82.5,82.7
many,82.7,83.0

at,83.2,85.4
the,85.4,85.5

or,86.8,87.2
5,87.2,87.3

not,91.0,91.1
very,91.1,91.3
happy,91.3,91.6
with,91.6,91.9
it,91.9,92.0
and,92.0,93.4
you,93.4,93.7

take,97.6,97.7
the,97.7,97.8

I,98.0,98.9
hate,98.9,99.3
that,99.3,99.5
I,99.5,100.0
hate,100.0,100.2

transporting,106.9,107.6
somewhere,107.6,108.0
else,108.0,108.2
and,108.2,111.8
I,111.8,114.5
realize,114.5,115.4
it,115.4,115.6
is,115.6,115.7
not,115.7,115.8
a,115.8,116.2

or,120.8,120.9
something,120.9,121.2
and,121.9,122.4
I,122.4,122.4
hate,122.4,122.7
those,122.7,123.0
planes,123.0,123.5
I've,123.5,123.6
had,123.6,123.9
my,123.9,124.4
worst,124.4,124.7
experiences,124.7,125.8
with,125.8,126.1
propeller,126.1,126.5
planes,126.5,127.0
I,127.0,127.7
think,127.7,127.9
they're,127.9,128.0
not,128.0,128.0
equipped,128.0,128.5
to,128.5,128.5
handle,128.5,128.7
bad,128.7,129.2
weather,129.2,129.5
for,129.5,129.8
starters,129.8,130.4
and,130.4,130.5
they,130.5,130.8
just,130.8,131.1
don't,131.1,131.5
work,131.5,132.1
that,132.1,132.2
well,132.2,132.5
when,132.5,132.7
the,132.7,132.9
weather,132.9,133.1
is,133.1,133.2
not,133.2,133.3
ideal,133.3,133.6
but,133.6,134.1
at,134.1,135.9
that,135.9,136.0
time,136.0,136.1
it,136.1,136.2
was,136.2,136.4
way,136.4,136.5
too,136.5,136.6
late,136.6,136.7
for,136.7,137.0

want,137.6,137.8
to,137.8,138.0
travel,138.0,138.1
so,138.1,139.0
I,139.0,139.1
said,139.1,139.4
let's,139.4,139.8

cease,143.7,146.7
and,146.7,146.8
desist,146.8,147.0
to,147.0,147.4
down,147.4,147.7

play,159.9,160.4
right,160.4,160.6
now,160.6,160.8

for,166.7,166.9
now,166.9,167.1
and,167.1,167.8
we,167.8,168.1
don't,168.1,168.2
know,168.2,168.4
how,168.4,168.4
long,168.4,168.6
it,168.6,168.9

what,218.6,218.9

20,290.9,291.7
30,291.7,291.9

I,327.9,328.0
can,328.0,328.1
breathe,328.1,328.3
again,328.3,328.4

then,329.1,329.2
next,329.2,329.9
15-20,329.9,330.3
minutes,330.3,330.6
we,330.6,331.0
were,331.0,331.1
just,331.1,331.3
doing,331.3,331.5
this,331.5,331.8

up,333.3,333.7
the,333.7,333.9

even,340.6,342.0
if,342.0,342.1
I,342.1,342.2

it,342.5,342.7
at,342.7,342.8
lifetime,342.8,343.2
just,343.2,343.6

about,344.7,344.7
it,344.7,345.1
