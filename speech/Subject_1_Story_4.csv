shoes,12.3,12.5
with,12.5,12.7
playing,12.7,13.2
that,13.2,13.5
I'm,13.5,16.7
really,16.7,17.0
scared,17.0,17.4
when,17.4,17.6
I'm,17.6,17.7
boarding,17.7,18.0
a,18.0,18.1
flight,18.1,18.1
I,18.1,22.5
always,22.5,23.0
suspected,23.0,23.1
a,23.1,24.0
thing,24.0,24.0
to,24.0,24.3
go,24.3,24.4
wrong,24.4,24.8
and,24.8,25.3
I've,25.3,25.6
never,25.6,25.8
had,25.8,26.0
an,26.0,26.1
experience,26.1,26.2
but,26.2,26.8
quite,26.8,27.2
recently,27.2,27.5
SUV,27.5,28.3
before,28.3,28.6
I,28.6,29.4
asked,29.4,29.6
you,29.6,29.6
what,29.6,29.8
have,29.8,30.0
I,30.0,30.2
was,30.2,30.3
traveling,30.3,30.9
to,30.9,31.5
Brazil,31.5,31.6
normally,31.6,33.3
what,33.3,33.6
I,33.6,33.6
would,33.6,33.8
do,33.8,33.9
it,33.9,34.1
like,34.1,34.3
take,34.3,34.4
a,34.4,34.5
train,34.5,34.9
from,34.9,35.1
Hamburg,35.1,35.4
and,35.4,35.8
I,35.8,35.9
go,35.9,36.0
there,36.0,36.2
but,36.2,37.4
my,37.4,38.6
cold,38.6,38.9
is,38.9,39.0
really,39.0,39.1
cheap,39.1,39.5
flight,39.5,39.9
on,39.9,40.0
your,40.0,40.3
way,40.3,40.5
home,40.5,40.6
then,40.6,40.9
I,40.9,40.9
thought,40.9,41.1
well,41.1,41.3
why,41.3,41.5
not,41.5,41.6
try,41.6,41.9
this,41.9,42.1
is,42.1,42.5
It's,42.5,43.1
150,43.1,44.2
or,44.2,44.4
160,44.4,44.8
of,44.8,45.0
the,45.0,45.2
journey,45.2,45.5
time,45.5,45.9
so,45.9,46.7
might,46.7,46.8
as,46.8,46.9
well,46.9,47.0
do,47.0,47.1
it,47.1,47.3
funny,47.3,48.9
thing,48.9,49.1
was,49.1,49.3
that,49.3,49.5
I,49.5,49.7
didn't,49.7,50.0
notice,50.0,50.1
it,50.1,50.4
was,50.4,50.6
light,50.6,51.0
when,51.0,51.1
I,51.1,51.3
was,51.3,51.4
looking,51.4,51.6
for,51.6,52.0
I,52.0,52.5
didn't,52.5,52.7
pay,52.7,53.1
attention,53.1,53.1
to,53.1,53.4
it.,53.4,53.6
The,53.6,53.7
flight,53.7,53.9
was,53.9,54.1
it,54.1,54.2
the,54.2,54.4
night,54.4,54.7
we,54.7,55.2
just,55.2,55.3
fine,55.3,55.7
for,55.7,55.9
me,55.9,56.0
and,56.0,56.1
work,56.1,56.3
fine,56.3,56.6
for,56.6,56.8
me,56.8,56.9
but,56.9,58.2
as,58.2,58.5
it,58.5,58.6
turned,58.6,58.9
out,58.9,59.1
it,59.1,60.0
was,60.0,60.1
adding,60.3,60.5
a,60.5,60.6
10,60.6,60.9
do,60.9,61.4
you,61.4,61.4
know,61.4,61.5
the,61.5,61.7
airports,61.7,62.1

Europe,62.2,62.3
close,62.3,62.8
at,62.8,62.9
10:30,62.9,63.8
or,63.8,63.9
so.,63.9,64.1
It,64.1,64.3
was,64.3,64.4
pretty,64.4,64.6
much,64.6,64.7
the,64.7,64.8
last,64.8,65.0
flight,65.0,65.6
7,65.6,67.4

from,68.0,72.3
going,72.3,72.7
on,72.7,73.0

at,74.7,74.8
least,74.8,74.9
the,74.9,75.1
airport,75.1,75.6
there,75.6,76.4
was,76.4,76.4
a,76.4,76.6
huge,76.6,76.7
cue,76.7,77.2
for,77.2,77.7
the,77.7,77.9
chicken,77.9,78.4

to,79.6,79.8
go,79.8,79.9
many,79.9,80.1
flights,80.1,80.5
going,80.5,80.7
at,80.7,80.9
that,80.9,81.0
time,81.0,81.0
because,81.0,81.3
of,81.3,81.5
the,81.5,81.6
storm,81.6,82.1
they,82.1,82.4
are,82.4,82.5
flights,82.5,82.8
delayed,82.8,82.8
somehow,82.8,84.7
I,84.7,85.1
had,85.1,85.2
to,85.2,85.4
go,85.4,85.5
to,85.5,85.7
the,85.7,85.7
check-in,85.7,86.2
process,86.2,86.4
because,86.4,87.0
that's,87.0,87.2
a,87.2,87.3
nugget,87.3,87.8
took,88.7,89.1
me,89.1,89.2
a,89.2,89.2
lot,89.2,89.3
of,89.3,89.4
time,89.4,89.6
for,89.6,89.8
that,89.8,90.0
to,90.0,90.2
happen,90.2,90.4
just,90.4,91.0
vanish,91.0,91.5
to,91.5,91.6
reach,91.6,91.9
the,91.9,92.1
flight,92.1,92.5
before,92.5,92.7
it,92.7,92.9
actually,92.9,93.1
took,93.1,93.4
off,93.4,93.7
before,93.7,95.4
the,95.4,95.9
boarding,95.9,96.5
started,96.5,96.8
voting,96.8,97.1
ended,97.1,97.5
be,97.5,98.9
bored,98.9,99.3
and,99.3,99.6
you,99.6,100.0
know,100.0,100.1
it's,100.1,100.8
not,100.8,100.8

bridge,102.0,102.3
on,102.3,102.4
it,102.4,102.6
so,102.6,102.7
you,102.7,102.8
have,102.8,102.9
to,102.9,103.0
get,103.0,103.2
down,103.2,103.4
get,103.4,103.7

I,118.7,118.8
don't,118.8,119.2
like,119.2,119.4
those,119.4,119.5
plans,119.5,119.9
because,119.9,120.1
of,120.1,120.3
the,120.3,120.4
propeller,120.4,120.8
I'm,120.8,120.9
always,120.9,121.2
really,121.2,121.4
scared,121.4,121.8
of,121.8,121.9
it,121.9,122.1
I'd,122.1,122.3
like,122.3,122.4
the,122.4,122.6
check,122.6,122.9
balance,122.9,123.2
with,123.2,123.7
more,123.7,124.0
secure,124.0,124.3
just,124.3,124.6
getting,124.6,124.9

going,131.7,131.9
wrong,131.9,132.2
at,132.2,132.4
that,132.4,132.5
point,132.5,132.7
of,132.7,132.8
time,132.8,133.1
we,133.1,135.3

weather,145.2,145.4
is,145.4,145.6
too,145.6,145.8
bad,145.8,145.9
well,145.9,146.3
I'm,146.3,146.4
like,146.4,146.6
that,146.6,147.9
before,147.9,148.1
the,148.7,149.1
weather,149.1,149.3
is,149.3,149.4
bad,149.4,149.6

then,149.8,150.2
this,150.2,150.4
delay,150.4,150.8
and,150.8,152.0
didn't,152.0,152.2
know,152.2,152.3
when,152.3,152.5
they,152.5,152.7
would,152.7,152.8
be,152.8,152.9
cleared,152.9,153.3
to,153.3,153.4
fly,153.4,153.5
it,153.5,154.6
turns,154.6,154.9
out,154.9,155.0
for,155.0,155.5
one,155.5,155.9
hour,155.9,156.3
in,156.3,156.4
the,156.4,156.6
plane,156.6,157.1
sitting,157.1,157.4
at,157.4,157.7
the,157.7,157.8
tarmac,157.8,158.2
the,158.2,159.1
plane,159.1,159.4
didn't,159.4,159.6
start,159.6,160.0
because,160.0,160.8
of,160.8,160.9
the,160.9,161.0
bad,161.0,161.3
weather,161.3,161.4
and,161.4,161.9
in,161.9,162.1
my,162.1,162.2
head,162.2,162.4
I'm,162.4,162.6
like,162.6,162.7
this,162.7,163.2
is,163.2,163.3
the,163.3,163.7
worst,163.7,164.1
being,164.1,164.4
already,164.4,164.6
that,164.6,165.0
I've,165.0,165.2
never,165.2,165.3
had,165.3,165.5
this,165.5,165.7
experience,165.7,165.8
while,165.8,166.2
I,166.2,166.3
was,166.3,166.4
sitting,166.4,166.6
in,166.6,166.7
a,166.7,166.8
plane,166.8,167.2
for,167.2,167.4
1,167.4,167.6
hour,167.6,167.9
you,167.9,168.0
know,168.0,168.2
they,168.2,168.3
don't,168.3,168.4
even,168.4,168.6
sit,168.6,168.8
on,168.8,168.9
the,168.9,169.0
AC,169.0,169.3
or,169.3,169.4
something,169.4,169.7
but,169.7,170.4
it's,170.4,170.5
waiting,170.5,171.0
it's,171.0,171.9
just,171.9,172.2
bad,172.2,172.5
then,172.5,174.7
after,174.7,175.0
1,175.0,175.2
hour,175.2,175.5
so,175.5,175.9
you,175.9,176.0
can,176.0,176.2
even,176.2,176.3
so,176.3,176.7
you,176.7,176.8
can,176.8,177.0
see,177.0,177.2
some,177.2,177.6
of,177.6,177.6
that,177.6,177.7
time,177.7,178.0
you,178.0,178.1
can,178.1,178.2
decide,178.2,178.6
I,178.6,178.7
don't,178.7,178.8
want,178.8,178.9
to,178.9,179.0
fly,179.0,179.1
anymore,179.1,179.4
I,179.4,180.0
go,180.0,180.2
out,180.2,180.4
because,180.4,180.5
he,180.5,180.7
wants,180.7,180.9
to,180.9,181.0
go,181.0,181.2
out,181.2,181.4
anymore,181.4,181.6
so,181.6,182.5
somehow,182.5,182.9
I,182.9,183.2
sat,183.2,184.2
through,184.2,184.5
and,184.5,184.7
I,184.7,184.8
thought,184.8,185.0
okay,185.0,185.2
well,185.2,185.4
let's,185.4,185.8
see,185.8,185.9
how,185.9,186.0
it,186.0,186.1
goes,186.1,186.2
after,186.2,188.1
1,188.1,188.3
hours,188.3,188.6
I,188.6,188.7
said,188.7,189.0
then,189.0,190.0
I,190.0,190.1
was,190.1,190.2
like,190.2,190.3
yeah,190.3,190.5
we,190.5,190.7
can,190.7,190.8
fly,190.8,191.1
now,191.1,191.3
so,191.3,192.5
the,192.5,192.6
plane,192.6,193.1
somehow,193.1,193.5
went,193.5,193.8
to,193.8,193.9
the,193.9,194.1
runway,194.1,195.1
and,195.1,195.5
it,195.5,195.6
took,195.6,195.8
office,195.8,197.3
really,197.3,197.6
shaky,197.6,198.0
because,198.0,198.2
of,198.2,198.4
the,198.4,198.5
wind,198.5,199.0
as,199.8,200.2
soon,200.2,200.3
as,200.3,200.5
we,200.5,200.6
decide,200.6,200.9
which,200.9,201.3
hi,201.3,201.6
I,201.6,201.8
mean,201.8,201.9
the,201.9,202.0
never,202.0,202.3

keep,204.9,205.1
it,205.1,205.3
as,205.3,205.6
soon,205.6,205.7
as,205.7,205.9
we,205.9,206.0
need,206.0,206.2
to,206.2,206.3
retire,206.3,206.7
it,206.7,208.0
started,208.0,208.5
tumbling,208.5,209.0
all,209.0,209.5
over,209.5,209.8
when,209.8,210.3
I,210.3,210.4
was,210.4,210.7
at,210.7,210.8
the,210.8,210.8
windowsill,210.8,211.1
as,211.1,211.4
I,211.4,211.5
could,211.5,211.7
see,211.7,211.8
that,211.8,211.9
was,211.9,212.2
lightning,212.2,212.7
outside,212.7,212.9
for,212.9,213.3
this,213.3,213.5
flashes,213.5,214.1
pretty,215.2,216.0
scary,216.0,216.4
that,216.4,216.5
experience,216.5,217.1
and,217.1,217.6
then,217.6,217.9
with,217.9,218.5
the,218.5,218.5
tumbling,218.5,218.8
in,218.8,219.2
with,219.2,219.4
the,219.4,219.5
Devil,219.5,219.8
is,219.8,220.1
happening,220.1,220.6
suddenly,220.6,221.1
the,221.1,221.2
lights,221.2,221.6
went,221.6,221.8
off,221.8,221.8
of,221.8,222.3
the,222.3,222.4
airplane,222.4,223.0
all,223.0,224.1
the,224.1,224.2
emergency,224.2,224.7
lights,224.7,225.0
to,225.0,227.3
not,227.3,227.5
panic,227.5,227.8
it's,227.8,228.2
Dublin,228.2,228.7
that,228.7,229.0
happens,229.0,229.6
in,229.6,229.8
my,229.8,230.2
head,230.2,230.4
things,230.4,231.1
are,231.1,231.1
going,231.1,231.3
crazy,231.3,231.6
cuz,231.6,232.6
I'm,232.6,232.7
thinking,232.7,232.9
I'm,232.9,233.1
thinking,233.1,233.2
I'm,233.2,233.4
going,233.4,233.5
to,233.5,233.6
die,233.6,233.8
now,233.8,233.9
this,233.9,235.7
is,235.7,236.0
really,236.0,236.1
scary,236.1,236.3
what,236.3,239.5
happened,239.5,239.8
eventually,239.8,240.0
was,240.0,240.5
that,240.5,240.8
after,240.8,242.1
5,242.1,242.5
minutes,242.5,242.8
of,242.8,242.8
the,242.8,242.9
lights,242.9,243.2
off,243.2,243.6
and,243.6,243.9
people,243.9,244.5
talking,244.5,244.9
to,244.9,245.4
the,245.4,245.5
else,245.5,245.9
to,245.9,246.1
say,246.1,246.5
what,246.5,246.6
is,246.6,246.7
docking,246.7,247.6
in,247.6,247.7
telling,247.7,247.9
us,247.9,248.1
to,248.1,248.2
become,248.2,248.8
and,248.8,248.9
everything,248.9,249.2
that,249.2,249.3
we,249.3,249.4
find,249.4,250.0
the,250.0,250.7
oxygen,250.7,251.3
masks,251.3,251.6
drop,251.6,251.7
off,251.7,252.1
first,252.1,252.5
to,252.5,252.9
plane,252.9,253.2
as,253.2,253.3
we,253.3,253.4
had,253.4,253.6
like,253.6,253.8
$344,253.8,255.7
something,255.7,256.0
suddenly,256.0,256.4
lost,256.4,257.2
oxygen,257.2,258.2
masks,258.2,258.9
fall,258.9,259.6
down,259.6,259.9
lamp,259.9,260.3
panicking,260.3,260.8
and,260.8,260.9
restocking,260.9,261.9
what,261.9,262.2
to,262.2,262.3
do,262.3,262.4
because,262.4,262.6
the,262.6,263.3
first,263.3,263.6
thing,263.6,263.6
is,263.6,263.8
happening,263.8,264.0
to,264.0,264.2
me,264.2,264.3
and,264.3,264.7
you,264.7,265.3
think,265.3,265.7
we,265.7,266.0
are,266.0,266.2
prepared,266.2,266.7
for,266.7,266.8
it,266.8,266.9
but,266.9,267.1
it,267.1,267.2
actually,267.2,267.5
happens,267.5,267.9
it's,267.9,268.0
really,268.0,268.3
scary,268.3,269.1
so,269.1,271.0
I'm,271.0,271.1
not,271.1,271.2
able,271.2,271.3
to,271.3,271.5
put,271.5,271.7
the,271.7,271.8
mask,271.8,272.2
on,272.2,272.2
my,272.2,272.5
face,272.5,272.6
and,272.6,273.1
I,273.1,273.2
can,273.2,273.5
read,273.5,273.8
because,273.8,273.9
the,273.9,274.3
plane,274.3,274.5
can,274.5,274.7
has,274.7,274.9
a,274.9,275.0
day,275.0,275.2
what,275.3,276.0
is,276.0,276.2
getting,276.2,276.5
really,276.5,276.7
Trouble,276.7,277.2
song,277.2,277.7
for,277.7,277.8
me,277.8,278.0
so,278.0,278.1
my,278.1,278.3
guy,278.3,279.0
sitting,279.0,279.2
next,279.2,279.3
to,279.3,279.5
me,279.5,279.7
actually,279.7,279.8
help,279.8,280.2
me,280.2,280.3
put,280.3,280.5
on,280.5,280.6
the,280.6,280.7
mask,280.7,281.2
like,281.2,281.5
I,281.5,282.0
could,282.0,282.3
do,282.3,282.3
for,282.3,282.5
you,282.5,282.6
but,282.6,284.9
then,284.9,285.2
again,285.2,285.4
after,285.4,285.6
the,285.6,285.8
mass,285.8,286.1
was,286.1,286.2
all,286.2,286.4
is,286.4,286.5
well,286.5,286.6
the,286.6,286.9
lights,286.9,287.1
are,287.1,287.2
still,287.2,287.4
off,287.4,287.6
and,287.6,288.0
no,288.0,290.0
flashes,290.0,290.3
outside,290.3,290.6
the,290.6,290.8
lightning,290.8,291.1
outside,291.1,291.4
you,291.4,291.6
can,291.6,291.8
see,291.8,291.8
the,291.8,292.0
splash,292.0,292.4
of,292.4,292.5
the,292.5,292.5
flight,292.5,292.8
coming,292.8,292.9
in,292.9,293.3
with,293.3,294.4
all,294.4,294.5
of,294.5,294.6
us,294.6,294.8
like,294.8,295.0
with,295.0,295.2
the,295.2,295.2
mask,295.2,295.6
and,295.6,295.7
with,295.7,295.9
this,295.9,296.0
propeller,296.0,296.6
planes,296.6,297.0
doing,297.0,297.2
so,297.2,299.3
scary,299.3,301.2
I,301.2,301.4
mean,301.4,301.5
this,301.5,301.7
is,301.7,301.8
the,301.8,301.9
skinniest,301.9,302.7
experience,302.7,303.2
and,303.2,303.4
then,303.4,303.7
off,303.7,304.8
like,304.8,305.1
20,305.1,305.4
minutes,305.4,305.7
of,305.7,305.8
this,305.8,305.9
happening,305.9,306.4
and,306.4,306.6
with,306.6,306.7
the,306.7,306.8
mouse,306.8,307.1
on,307.1,307.4
it,307.4,307.5
suddenly,307.5,307.9
game,307.9,308.9
picture,308.9,309.3
of,309.3,309.4
it,309.4,309.6
smoother,309.6,310.2
I,310.2,310.2
think,310.2,310.5
when,310.5,311.6
we,311.6,311.7
closer,311.7,312.2
to,312.2,312.4
the,312.4,313.5
definition,313.5,314.9
is,314.9,315.9
starting,315.9,316.2
to,316.2,316.3
become,316.3,316.5
"really,",316.5,317.2
they,317.2,318.3
will,318.3,318.5
probably,318.5,318.8
flying,318.8,319.3
in,319.3,319.5
a,319.5,319.5
different,319.5,319.9
note,319.9,320.0
to,320.0,320.1
do,320.1,320.2
something,320.2,320.6
to,320.6,320.8
do,320.8,320.9
that,320.9,321.2
yeah,323.5,324.0
so,324.0,324.3
then,324.3,324.6
they,324.6,324.8
turned,324.8,325.1
off,325.1,325.1
the,325.1,325.2
mass,325.2,325.6
of,325.6,326.0
and,326.0,326.2
we,326.2,326.4
took,326.4,326.5
it,326.5,326.7
off,326.7,327.1
and,327.1,327.2
we,327.2,327.5
have,327.5,327.6
Landing,327.6,328.1
in,328.1,328.2
the,328.2,328.3
landing,328.3,328.8
was,328.8,329.0
bumpy,329.0,329.5
that,329.5,329.8
was,329.8,330.0
not,330.0,330.3
like,330.3,330.6
Chucky,330.6,331.3
landing,331.3,331.7
and,331.7,331.8
everything,331.8,332.2
probably,332.2,334.2
one,334.2,334.7
of,334.7,334.8
the,334.8,334.9
worst,334.9,335.0
flying,335.0,335.7
experiences,335.7,336.6
of,336.6,336.7
my,336.7,336.8
life,336.8,337.0
is,337.0,338.5
something,338.5,338.9
that,338.9,338.9
I,338.9,339.1
always,339.1,339.3
did,339.3,339.6
that,339.6,339.9
something,339.9,340.2
like,340.2,340.3
that,340.3,340.5
would,340.5,340.7
happen,340.7,340.8
that,340.8,342.3
feeling,342.3,342.8
of,342.8,342.8
the,342.8,342.9
plane,342.9,343.8
was,343.8,344.0
falling,344.0,344.4
at,344.4,344.5
fairly,344.5,345.0
low,345.0,345.3
because,345.3,345.6
it,345.6,346.2
feels,346.2,346.5
like,346.5,346.6
you're,346.6,346.8
dying,346.8,347.0
and,347.0,347.5
you,347.5,348.4
can,348.4,348.6
read,348.6,349.0
because,349.0,349.1
the,349.1,349.4
oxygen,349.4,349.8
is,349.8,349.9
getting,349.9,350.2
free,350.2,350.6
Louis,350.6,350.9
prima's,350.9,351.4
Free,351.4,351.6
Falling,351.6,352.0
it,353.5,355.1
was,355.1,355.3
scary,355.3,355.6
I,355.6,355.7
appreciate,355.7,356.2
the,356.2,356.7
pilot,356.7,357.9
was,357.9,358.1
able,358.1,358.3
to,358.3,358.4
manage,358.4,358.8
all,358.8,358.9
of,358.9,359.0
that,359.0,359.3
but,359.3,359.5
for,359.5,360.0
me,360.0,360.2
I,360.2,360.8
would,360.8,361.0
probably,361.0,361.1
never,361.1,361.6
fly,361.6,362.0
this,362.0,362.2
flight,362.2,362.6
from,362.6,362.7
Hamburg,362.7,364.5
to,364.5,364.9
check,364.9,367.2
which,367.2,367.4
light,367.4,367.7
is,367.7,367.9
it,367.9,368.0
is,368.0,368.1
the,368.1,368.2
total,368.2,368.4
is,368.4,368.7
it,368.7,368.8
the,368.8,368.9
propeller,368.9,369.3
plane,369.3,369.6
or,369.6,369.7
something,369.7,370.0
I,370.0,370.1
think,370.1,370.1
something,370.1,370.6
will,370.6,370.7
develop,370.7,370.8
brains,370.8,371.4
I,371.4,371.5
think,371.5,371.7
I,371.7,371.8
hated,371.8,372.1
on,372.1,373.4
my,373.4,373.6
way,373.6,373.7
back,373.7,373.9
already,373.9,374.8
but,374.8,375.1
I,375.1,375.3
cancelled,375.3,375.8
the,375.8,375.9
flag,375.9,376.2
and,376.2,376.3
then,376.3,376.5
take,376.5,376.7
the,376.7,376.8
fire,376.8,377.1
that,377.1,377.2
took,377.2,377.3
too,377.3,377.5
long,377.5,378.1
train,378.1,378.9
because,378.9,379.1
well,379.1,379.6
at,379.6,379.9
least,379.9,380.0
there's,380.0,380.4
a,380.4,380.5
train,380.5,380.8
or,380.8,385.0
something,385.0,385.3
crazy.,385.3,391.2
I,391.2,391.5
probably,391.5,393.4
scarred,393.4,394.0
