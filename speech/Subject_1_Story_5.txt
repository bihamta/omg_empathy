Yeah, I was thinking these days about old-time so high school time you like it really was bad. Really? Oh, wow. I was really really bad grades and people wonder around me was really weird people. So the students had the friends in high school, so it was strange.
People are strange Echo Electric to do all of them the teachers were so bad. They were so so bad. Everything was so awful. I did not pay you to know what you'd like for which it was actually the only good teacher in the whole school was the history teacher and he was a very nice guy very cool guy. The chorus says the subject used CD burning from you was a lot of things a lot of names to remember a lot of ways. I can't wait to do that today.
Yeah, but he we can make it like okay one section up that bathroom to attend to his class and they're starting to like it and toe and then we had the first exam. I failed miserably was super super bad was he like awful but I talk to me and then he came in and then he started to to to talk to me the different ways of none of the other teachers before kind of nicely. Yeah. The problem is not the subject. I'm the one who are making this harder than it should be right, you know how to study a bit more baby more things from the class and then I did my second test and I passed his test so I can do that.
Marginal borderline actually did something but I was completely don't have no self confidence at all. And then what they do, they make a plan to cheat on me. I need some papers that I put on my sleeve. So, you know if they 2 numbers and the name that song and I was like yeah. Wow, I feel really bad. I felt so guilty. So so guilty for doing that for for breaking the trust of that guy. I know that that's one person that could connect I handing the exam and the teacher was very happy.
So so so battery life while how can I do that? You know and you wanted it sounds really bad that everytime I think about it. It was just a bad move.
