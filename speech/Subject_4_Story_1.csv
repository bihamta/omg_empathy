what,130.4,130.6
we,130.6,130.6
were,130.6,130.8
thinking,130.8,130.9
it,130.9,131.2
was,131.2,137.6
just,137.6,137.7
kind,137.7,138.0

a,142.3,142.4
total,142.4,142.6
this,142.6,142.8
hill,142.8,143.1
and,143.1,143.2
then,143.2,143.4
listen,143.4,143.8
to,143.8,144.0
the,144.0,144.1
someone,144.1,144.6
else,144.6,144.8
was,144.8,144.9
in,144.9,145.0
the,145.0,145.2
other,145.2,145.3
one,145.3,145.5
was,145.5,145.7
actually,145.7,154.4
in,154.4,154.7
the,154.7,154.8
beginning,154.8,155.0
it,155.0,157.3
wasn't,157.3,158.2
the,158.2,158.4
best,158.4,158.5
idea,158.5,158.8
to,158.8,164.7
put,164.7,165.7
all,165.7,165.7
the,165.7,165.9
stuff,165.9,165.9

it,180.4,180.5
was,180.5,180.6
kind,180.6,182.0
of,182.0,182.1

it,184.6,184.8
starts,184.8,185.1
about,185.1,188.6
so,188.6,189.0
I,189.0,189.0
was,189.0,189.2
like,189.2,189.3
landing,189.3,189.7

so,274.4,274.6
I,274.6,274.7
didn't,274.7,275.1
hear,275.1,275.5
from,275.5,275.7
you,275.7,275.8
for,275.8,275.9
quite,275.9,276.0
a,276.0,276.2
long,276.2,276.3
time,276.3,276.5
actually,276.5,276.8
eventually,276.8,278.1
get,278.1,278.8
in,278.8,278.9
touch,278.9,279.2
with,279.2,279.4
me,279.4,279.6
in,279.6,280.0
5,280.0,283.2
years,283.2,283.4
later,283.4,283.8
kind,283.8,284.2
of,284.2,284.2
it,284.2,284.3
was,284.3,284.4
about,284.4,284.7
time,284.7,284.9
you,284.9,285.1
receive,285.1,285.9
this,285.9,286.0
Michigan,286.0,286.4
touch,286.4,286.7
with,286.7,286.9
me,286.9,287.0
again,287.0,287.1
about,287.1,295.3
the,295.3,295.6
way,295.6,295.6
she,295.6,295.8
was,295.8,295.9
kind,295.9,296.4
of,296.4,296.4
a,296.4,296.5
joke,296.5,296.9
with,296.9,297.1
her,297.1,297.1
about,297.1,297.1
the,297.1,297.4
pause,297.4,297.7
and,297.7,298.5
we,298.5,298.7
talked,298.7,299.0
for,299.0,299.2
a,299.2,300.2
while,300.2,300.5
but,300.5,301.1
I,301.1,301.4
guess,301.4,307.7
that's,307.7,307.8
what,307.8,308.1
happens,308.1,308.5
when,308.5,308.7
you,308.7,309.2
were,309.2,309.3
a,309.3,309.4
kid,309.4,309.4
or,309.4,310.1
somewhere,310.1,310.5
is,310.5,310.6
that,310.6,310.8
you,310.8,311.0
do,311.0,311.2
change,311.2,311.5
pretty,311.5,311.7
quickly,311.7,312.0
our,316.0,316.4
conversations,316.4,316.9
became,316.9,317.1
discount,317.1,317.5
shorter,317.5,317.8
and,317.8,318.0
shorter,318.0,318.0
and,318.0,318.6
attention,318.6,319.1
he's,319.1,319.4
just,319.4,319.6
kind,319.6,319.9
of,319.9,320.0
stopped,320.0,320.6
responding,320.6,320.8
to,320.8,321.2
my,321.2,321.3
texts,321.3,321.7
which,321.7,322.0
is,322.0,322.2
same,323.5,324.3
universe,324.3,324.6
as,324.6,324.8
like,324.8,325.1
what,325.1,326.7
you,326.7,326.8
going,326.8,326.9
to,326.9,327.0
do,327.0,327.1
about,327.1,327.3
it,327.3,327.5
that,329.2,329.7
was,329.7,330.6
the,330.6,330.7
story,330.7,330.9
of,330.9,331.0
another,331.0,331.2
for,331.2,331.4
my,331.4,331.5
face,331.5,331.8
when,331.8,331.9
I'm,331.9,332.0
in,332.0,332.1
Sweden,332.1,332.6
I,332.6,337.9
change,337.9,342.0
the,342.0,342.1
locks,342.1,342.4
