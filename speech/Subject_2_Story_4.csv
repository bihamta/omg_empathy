hey,0.6000000000000001,1.0
how,1.0,1.2
you,1.2,1.3
doing,1.3,1.4
long,1.4,4.0
time,4.0,4.1
to,4.1,12.8
find,12.8,13.1
recent,13.1,13.4
thing,13.4,13.6
the,13.6,14.1
last,14.1,15.1
week,15.1,15.5
so,15.5,15.7
it's,15.7,15.8
all,15.8,16.0
happening,16.0,24.9
last,24.9,25.0
week,25.0,25.5
and,25.5,26.5
I'm,26.5,26.6
going,26.6,26.7
to,26.7,26.8
have,26.8,27.0
to,27.0,27.1
go,27.1,27.2
to,27.2,27.4
the,27.4,27.5
cell,27.5,27.9
which,27.9,28.1
is,28.1,28.2
not,28.2,28.4
that,28.4,28.5
far,28.5,28.6
away,28.6,28.8
so,28.8,29.3
I,29.3,29.4
could,29.4,29.5
technically,29.5,30.0
take,30.0,30.1
a,30.1,30.3
train,30.3,30.7
but,30.7,31.4
I,31.4,31.4
found,31.4,31.6
this,31.6,31.8
deal,31.8,32.2
online,32.2,32.8
on,32.8,33.3
your,33.3,33.6
wings,33.6,33.8
and,33.8,34.0
it,34.0,34.1
was,34.1,34.3
really,34.3,34.5
cheap,34.5,34.6
flight,34.6,35.1
I,35.1,35.1
could,35.1,35.3
fly,35.3,35.7
from,35.7,35.9
there,35.9,36.2
so,36.2,37.5
I,37.5,37.5
took,37.5,37.7
it,37.7,37.8
I,37.8,38.0
didn't,38.0,38.3
realize,38.3,38.8
I,38.8,38.9
mean,38.9,39.0
I,39.0,39.2
did,39.2,39.5
see,39.5,39.6
that,39.6,39.8
it,39.8,39.9
was,39.9,40.1
in,40.1,40.4
the,40.4,40.5
night,40.5,40.8
when,40.8,41.1
I,41.1,41.2
applied,41.2,41.6
but,41.6,41.8
I,41.8,42.1
didn't,42.1,42.3
realize,42.3,42.4
it,42.4,42.6
was,42.6,42.8
that,42.8,43.4
late,43.4,43.7
so,43.7,44.0
I,44.0,44.0
said,44.0,44.6
then,44.6,44.8
it'll,44.8,45.4
most,45.4,45.7
of,45.7,45.8
the,45.8,45.8
flights,45.8,46.0
in,46.0,46.1
Europe,46.1,46.2
airports,46.2,47.4
don't,47.4,47.5
fly,47.5,47.8
in,47.8,47.9
the,47.9,48.0
night,48.0,48.0
think,48.0,48.7
about,48.7,48.7
that,48.7,49.0
was,49.0,49.1
like,49.1,49.3
the,49.3,49.4
last,49.4,49.6
flight,49.6,50.1
of,50.1,50.3
so,50.3,50.5
at,50.5,51.2
10:10,51.2,52.1
p.m.,52.1,52.4
airport,52.4,54.5
I,54.5,54.5
was,54.5,54.7
already,54.7,55.4
and,55.4,55.7
it,55.7,55.8
was,55.8,56.0
pretty,56.0,57.0
epic,57.0,57.2
store,57.2,57.7
me,57.7,57.8
because,57.8,58.2
I,58.2,58.3
can't,58.3,58.6
focus,58.6,60.2
something,60.5,61.0
at,61.0,61.8
least,61.8,62.0
there,62.0,62.4
and,62.4,62.7
there's,62.7,63.3
a,63.3,63.4
huge,63.4,63.6
queue,63.6,64.0
for,64.0,64.2
checking,64.2,64.6
because,64.6,64.8
apparently,64.8,65.3
a,65.3,65.9
lot,65.9,66.0
of,66.0,66.1
flights,66.1,66.4
for,66.4,66.6
today,66.6,66.8
and,66.8,67.0
everything,67.0,67.5
so,67.5,69.3
it,69.3,69.4
took,69.4,69.6
me,69.6,69.8
like,69.8,70.0
in,70.0,70.2
almost,70.2,71.5
an,71.5,71.5
hour,71.5,71.7
to,71.7,71.9
get,71.9,72.0
through,72.0,72.2
the,72.2,72.5
check,72.5,72.7
in,72.7,73.0
and,73.0,73.2
everything,73.2,73.6
they,73.6,74.2
all,74.2,74.3
do,74.3,74.5
it,74.5,74.6
easily,74.6,74.8
for,74.8,75.2
the,75.2,75.3
flight,75.3,75.6
but,75.6,75.7
then,75.7,75.9
I,75.9,76.0
realized,76.0,76.2
that,76.2,76.7
I,76.7,77.0
was,77.0,77.2
while,77.2,78.1
I,78.1,78.2
was,78.2,78.3
checking,78.3,78.4
in,78.4,78.6
15,78.6,79.8
to,79.8,79.8
20,79.8,79.9
minutes,79.9,80.1
left,80.1,80.4
for,80.4,80.6
me,80.6,80.7
to,80.7,80.8
do,80.8,81.5
the,81.5,81.6
check,81.6,81.9
in,81.9,82.1
by,82.1,85.9
the,85.9,86.0
time,86.0,86.1
I,86.1,86.2
managed,86.2,86.6
to,86.6,86.7
ditch,86.7,86.8
the,86.8,87.1
boarding,87.1,87.6
they,87.6,87.7
were,87.7,87.9
kind,87.9,88.1
of,88.1,88.2
closing,88.2,88.6
it,88.6,88.7
down,88.7,88.8
but,88.8,89.2
they,89.2,89.3
let,89.3,89.6
me,89.6,89.7
in,89.7,90.0
have,92.1,92.5
you,92.5,92.6
boarded,92.6,92.8
the,92.8,92.9
plane,92.9,93.0
so,93.0,94.0
you,94.0,94.1
know,94.1,94.2
when,94.2,94.9
you,94.9,95.0
boarded,95.0,95.4
tell,95.4,95.7
the,95.7,95.9
airport,95.9,96.2
so,96.2,96.3
don't,96.3,96.5
have,96.5,96.7
the,96.7,96.8
bridges,96.8,97.3
so,97.3,97.5
you,97.5,97.6
have,97.6,97.7
to,97.7,97.8
go,97.8,97.9
down,97.9,98.1
in,98.1,98.2
the,98.2,98.3
bus,98.3,98.7
and,98.7,98.9
the,98.9,99.0
bus,99.0,99.0
takes,99.0,99.4
you,99.4,99.5
to,99.5,99.6
pretend,99.6,100.0
it,100.0,100.7
was,100.7,100.8
one,100.8,101.0
of,101.0,101.0
those,101.0,101.2
which,101.2,103.1
is,103.1,103.2
already,103.2,103.3
starting,103.3,105.2
to,105.2,105.2
feel,105.2,105.3
a,105.3,105.5
bit,105.5,105.5
grumpy,105.5,105.7
about,105.7,106.0
it,106.0,106.2
because,106.2,106.4
I,106.4,106.6
don't,106.6,106.6
even,106.6,106.9
like,106.9,107.4
that,107.4,107.5
but,107.5,109.3
when,109.3,109.9
we,109.9,110.1
reach,110.1,110.4
the,110.4,111.0
plane,111.0,111.4
we,111.4,111.6
realize,111.6,112.1
what,112.1,112.2
I,112.2,112.3
realized,112.3,112.6
it,112.6,112.9
was,112.9,113.0
a,113.0,113.1
really,113.1,113.2
small,113.2,113.6
playing,113.6,114.1
you,114.1,114.2
know,114.2,114.3

I,117.1,117.8
had,117.8,118.2
those,118.2,118.4

of,119.6,119.8
this,119.8,119.9
and,119.9,120.5
never,120.5,120.7
feel,120.7,120.9
safe,120.9,121.2
on,121.2,121.5
it,121.5,121.6
I,121.6,121.7
like,121.7,121.9
like,121.9,122.3
to,122.3,122.5

secure,124.4,124.9
in,124.9,125.1
my,125.1,125.3

at,128.5,129.1
that,129.1,129.3

I,129.7,129.9
had,129.9,130.1
no,130.1,130.4

you,227.8,228.9
know,228.9,229.0
the,229.0,229.2

I,235.2,235.4
thought,235.4,235.5
I,235.5,235.6
was,235.6,235.8
going,235.8,235.9
to,235.9,236.0
die,236.0,236.1

I,248.7,248.9
never,248.9,249.2
used,249.2,249.9
it,249.9,250.2
before,250.2,250.4
I,250.4,250.7
never,250.7,250.9
had,250.9,251.1
this,251.1,251.2

so,256.8,256.9
and,256.9,257.1
I,257.1,257.2
can't,257.2,257.4

I,258.3,258.8
was,258.8,259.0
just,259.0,259.3
I,259.3,259.5
was,259.5,259.5
just,259.5,259.7
shaking,259.7,260.1
with,260.1,260.5
that,260.5,260.6

on,264.7,264.9
that,264.9,265.5
I,265.5,265.5
could,265.5,265.7
be,265.7,265.8
there,265.8,265.9
again,265.9,266.1
but,266.1,266.4
another,266.4,268.4
couple,268.4,268.7
of,268.7,268.9
like,268.9,269.8
10,269.8,270.1
seconds,270.1,270.5
because,270.5,277.2
they,277.2,277.5
were,277.5,277.6
the,277.6,277.7

coming,283.2,283.5
in,283.5,283.7
sideways,283.7,284.0
so,284.0,284.2
scary,284.2,284.5
it's,284.5,284.7
like,284.7,284.8

minutes,289.2,289.4
later,289.4,289.5
I,289.5,289.8
can,289.8,290.0
I,290.0,290.1
stabilize,290.1,290.4
we,290.4,291.0
actually,291.0,291.2

again,298.4,299.0
I,299.0,299.1

nearing,301.1,301.5
the,301.5,301.6

well,315.7,315.9
we,315.9,316.1
just,316.1,316.3
bounce,316.3,316.7
twice,316.7,316.9
before,316.9,317.6
