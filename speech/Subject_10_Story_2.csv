yeah,117.1,117.3
she,117.3,117.5
was,117.5,117.9
stable,117.9,118.9
sfv,119.9,122.4
terrifying,122.4,124.8
and,124.8,125.0
the,125.0,125.1

angry,146.5,147.0
all,147.0,147.1
the,147.1,147.2
time,147.2,147.3
so,147.3,150.0
it,150.0,150.4
was,150.4,156.2
kind,156.2,156.5
of,156.5,156.5
okay,156.5,156.7
with,156.7,158.8
taking,158.8,159.0
the,159.0,159.2
two,159.2,159.5
later,159.5,159.8
you,159.8,159.9
is,159.9,160.1
kind,160.1,160.5
if,161.4,162.8
he,162.8,162.9
was,162.9,163.1
going,163.1,163.1
to,163.1,163.2
find,163.2,163.6

the,163.9,163.9
first,163.9,164.4
year,164.4,164.6
kinds,164.6,165.1
of,165.1,165.2
eventually,165.2,166.2
we,166.2,166.4
got,166.4,166.5
to,166.5,166.6
this,166.6,166.8
point,166.8,166.9
where,166.9,167.2
we,167.2,167.4
have,167.4,167.5
to,167.5,167.5
get,167.5,167.6
this,167.6,167.8
big,167.8,168.0
presentation,168.0,168.4
classical,168.4,169.0
music,169.0,169.3

of,169.8,169.8
the,169.8,170.0
entire,170.0,170.1
class,170.1,170.4
at,170.4,173.4
that,173.4,173.5
point,173.5,173.8
in,173.8,174.1
time,174.1,174.1
for,174.1,175.5
the,175.5,175.6
scariest,175.6,176.0
prospective,176.0,176.4
just,176.4,176.8
pretending,176.8,177.1
friend,177.1,177.4
I,186.5,186.9
just,186.9,187.3
got,187.3,187.4
a,187.4,187.5
sizable,187.5,188.3
crowd,188.3,188.7
for,188.7,188.8
someone,188.8,189.0
so,189.0,189.2
young.,189.2,189.6
Prisons,189.6,190.1
in,190.1,190.2
front,190.2,190.4
of,190.4,190.5
you,190.5,190.6
in,190.6,190.7
the,190.7,190.8
hospital,190.8,198.7
so,198.7,199.0
I,199.0,199.1
have,199.1,199.3
to,199.3,199.3
present,199.3,199.5
for,199.5,199.8
the,199.8,199.9
teacher,199.9,200.3
who,200.3,200.3
wrote,200.3,200.7
the,200.7,201.2
show,201.2,201.4
was,201.4,201.7
very,201.7,202.0
wise,202.0,210.7
I,210.7,210.8
really,210.8,211.1
would,211.1,211.2
have,211.2,211.3
some,211.3,211.5
friends,211.5,211.7
under,211.7,211.9
a,211.9,212.1
kind,212.1,212.6
of,212.6,212.6
make,212.6,212.9
sure,212.9,213.0
it,213.0,213.2
would,213.2,213.4
be,213.4,213.5
good,213.5,213.7
for,213.7,215.2
the,215.2,215.3
day,215.3,215.4
came,215.4,215.8
I,215.8,216.0
gave,216.0,216.2
a,216.2,216.3
presentation,216.3,216.8
I,216.8,217.2
was,217.2,217.5
very,217.5,217.8
happy,217.8,218.0
with,218.0,218.4
it,218.4,218.5
like,218.5,218.8
people,218.8,219.3
clap,219.3,219.7
when,219.7,219.7
the,219.7,224.0
teacher,224.0,224.2
said,224.2,224.4
to,224.4,224.4
give,224.4,224.6
feedback,224.6,224.8
if,224.8,225.3
I,225.3,225.4
ripped,225.4,225.7
into,225.7,225.9
my,225.9,226.2
what's,226.2,226.7
it,226.7,226.9
called,226.9,227.3
okay,227.3,234.9
I,234.9,235.0
really,235.0,235.4
just,235.4,235.6
like,235.6,235.7
mean-spirited,235.7,237.0
constructive,237.0,238.7
a,238.7,238.7
tool,238.7,239.0
difficult,246.7,247.5
for,247.5,247.7
me,247.7,247.9
to,247.9,248.1
parse,248.1,249.3
the,249.3,249.3
information,249.3,249.9
I,249.9,250.0
suppose,250.0,250.4
is,250.4,250.5
like,250.5,250.7
the,250.7,250.8
kind,250.8,251.5
of,251.5,251.6
Reserve,251.6,251.8
that,251.8,252.2
so,254.0,254.3
essentially,254.3,254.8
I,254.8,255.5
didn't,255.5,255.9
get,255.9,256.1
the,256.1,266.0
phone,266.0,266.1
number,266.1,266.4
of,266.4,266.5
boards,266.5,267.1
by,267.1,267.2
she,267.2,267.4
sent,267.4,267.6
you,267.6,267.7
there,267.7,267.9
to,267.9,268.0
stay,268.0,268.3
is,268.3,268.5
what,268.5,268.6
they,268.6,268.8
kind,268.8,269.1
of,269.1,269.1
said,269.1,269.3
so,279.2,280.0
we,280.0,280.0
discuss,280.0,280.4
with,280.4,280.5
them,280.5,280.5
and,280.5,280.7
actually,280.7,281.2
came,281.2,281.5
to,281.5,281.6
the,281.6,281.7
solution,281.7,282.3
that,282.3,282.4
we,282.4,282.6
could,282.6,282.7
transfer,282.7,283.1
me,283.1,283.2
to,283.2,283.7
kind,283.7,284.1
of,284.1,284.2
is,284.2,284.5
a,284.5,284.5
high,284.5,284.7
school,284.7,284.8
which,284.8,285.1
of,285.1,285.2
the,285.2,285.3
ship,285.3,285.5
number,285.5,285.7
of,285.7,285.8
courses,285.8,286.1
with,286.1,286.4
music,286.4,287.9
or,287.9,288.1
in,288.1,288.1
this,288.1,288.3
one,288.3,288.6
and,288.6,289.0
we,289.0,289.2
could,289.2,290.5
transfer,290.5,290.8
me,290.8,291.2
over,291.2,291.4
to,291.4,291.5
this,291.5,291.7
normal,291.7,292.2
school,292.2,292.7
program,292.7,293.6
essentially,293.6,294.1
as,294.1,294.8
well,294.8,294.9
continue,294.9,295.1
my,295.1,295.4
education,295.4,295.5
so,295.5,296.1
I,296.1,296.3
could,296.3,296.5
avoid,296.5,296.5
these,296.5,296.8
mandatory,296.8,297.0
music,297.0,297.5
courses,297.5,297.9
that,297.9,298.0
were,298.0,298.2
required,298.2,298.5
by,298.5,298.6
the,298.6,298.8

removing,299.7,303.7
studying,303.7,304.3
music,304.3,304.5
grateful,304.5,306.4
she,306.4,306.9
made,306.9,307.1
my,307.1,307.3
life,307.3,307.5
singuila,307.5,308.5
miserable,308.5,308.7
I,308.7,309.1
kind,309.1,309.4
of,309.4,309.5
store,309.5,310.3
in,310.3,311.3
my,311.3,312.3
parents,312.3,312.8
to,312.8,313.0
say,313.0,315.7
yes,315.7,318.5
I,318.5,318.9

quite,328.6,328.8
a,328.8,328.9
long,328.9,328.9
time,328.9,329.2
I,329.6,330.7

I,333.3,335.6
did,335.6,335.8
and,335.8,340.4
he,340.4,341.8
said,341.8,341.9
