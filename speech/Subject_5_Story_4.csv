what's,0.8,1.8
down,1.8,1.9
me,1.9,3.4
almost,3.4,4.7
I,4.7,5.0
had,5.0,5.2
this,5.2,5.4
a,5.4,6.6
couple,6.6,6.9
of,6.9,7.0
weeks,7.0,7.1
be,7.1,7.5
the,7.5,8.8
last,8.8,9.1
weekend,9.1,9.5
actually,9.5,9.6
I,9.6,9.9
was,9.9,10.1
traveling,10.1,10.5
to,10.5,10.7
Brazil,10.7,11.3
and,11.3,12.3
I,12.3,19.0
was,19.0,19.2
meeting,19.2,19.4
a,19.4,19.6
friend,19.6,19.9
over,19.9,20.0
there,20.0,20.1
so,20.1,21.0
I,21.0,21.3
found,21.3,22.1
this,22.1,22.4
cheap,22.4,22.9
flight,22.9,23.5
on,23.5,23.6
lying,23.6,24.1
and,24.1,24.2
all,24.2,24.4
these,24.4,24.5
websites,24.5,25.6
you,25.6,25.7
can,25.7,25.9
find,25.9,26.2
this,26.2,26.3
last,26.3,26.7
minute,26.7,26.8
deals,26.8,27.2

the,30.5,30.8
last,30.8,31.4
Friday,31.4,31.9
evening,31.9,32.0
so,32.0,33.4
I,33.4,36.1
thought,36.1,36.3
it,36.3,36.5
was,36.5,36.6
really,36.6,36.7
cheap,36.7,36.9
so,36.9,37.2
I,37.2,37.2
thought,37.2,37.4
I'll,37.4,37.5
take,37.5,37.7
it,37.7,37.9
it,37.9,39.1
was,39.1,39.2
an,39.2,39.3

within,45.2,45.5
the,45.5,45.7
next,45.7,45.8
day,45.8,46.1
I,46.1,48.0
was,48.0,48.1
actually,48.1,48.3
I,48.3,48.6
reached,48.6,49.0
the,49.0,49.1
airport,49.1,49.3
a,49.3,49.5
couple,49.5,49.6
of,49.6,49.8
hours,49.8,49.9
early,49.9,50.7
you,50.7,51.0
know,51.0,51.2
I,51.2,51.3
went,51.3,51.8

a,61.3,61.5
delay,61.5,61.7
or,61.7,61.8

gladly,99.4,101.7
take,101.7,108.9
the,108.9,109.0
bus,109.0,109.4
that,109.4,109.4
was,109.4,109.7
the,109.7,109.8
worst,109.8,110.3
I,110.3,110.8
hate,110.8,110.9
taking,110.9,111.5
the,111.5,111.7
bus,111.7,111.7
so,111.7,113.1

then,117.2,117.5
I,117.5,117.7
realize,117.7,118.3
they,118.3,118.8
were,118.8,119.0
just,119.0,119.2
really,119.2,119.3

like,127.8,128.0
propeller,128.0,128.3
planes,128.3,128.6
I,128.6,128.7
just,128.7,128.9
don't,128.9,129.1
feel,129.1,129.3
really,129.3,129.5
secure,129.5,129.7
and,129.7,130.1
I,130.1,130.1
like,130.1,130.4
the,130.4,130.5
big,130.5,132.2

and,134.9,135.7
they,135.7,135.8
just,135.8,136.0
rushed,136.0,136.3
because,136.3,136.4
it,136.4,136.7
was,136.7,136.8
getting,136.8,136.9

fly,150.4,150.7
right,150.7,150.9
now,150.9,151.2

very,180.9,181.1
smooth,181.1,181.7
it,181.7,181.8
was,181.8,181.8
wavering,181.8,182.4
