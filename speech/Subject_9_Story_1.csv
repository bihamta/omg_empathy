to,124.8,125.0
keep,125.0,125.2

like,126.1,126.3
making,126.3,126.6
Furniture,126.6,126.8
so,126.8,127.2
they,127.2,127.2
had,127.2,127.4
to,127.4,127.5
be,127.5,127.6
yard,127.6,127.9
where,127.9,128.1
they,128.1,128.2
had,128.2,128.3

so,129.7,130.8
what,130.8,131.0
we,131.0,131.6
would,131.6,131.8
do,131.8,131.9
is,131.9,132.1
when,132.1,132.2
she,132.2,132.3
would,132.3,132.5
sneak,132.5,132.6
in,132.6,132.9
and,132.9,133.7
we,133.7,133.8
would,133.8,133.9
kind,133.9,134.3
of,134.3,134.3
takes,134.3,135.1
blank,135.1,135.4
thanks,135.4,136.4
we,136.4,137.5
would,137.5,137.6
use,137.6,137.9
these,137.9,138.0
two,138.0,138.2
bills,138.2,138.4
I,138.4,138.5
can,138.5,138.6
add,138.6,147.7
an,147.7,147.8
extra,147.8,147.9
seat,147.9,148.5
when,148.5,148.7
we,148.7,148.7
would,148.7,148.9
add,148.9,149.2
like,149.2,149.3
a,149.3,149.7
trunk,149.7,150.1
and,150.1,150.3
then,150.3,150.4
we,150.4,150.4
would,150.4,150.6
add,150.6,150.8
spoilers,150.8,151.3
to,151.3,151.4
make,151.4,151.5
it,151.5,151.6
grow,151.6,151.8
faster,151.8,151.8
with,151.8,152.4
something,152.4,152.6
out,152.6,152.7
of,152.7,152.8
a,152.8,160.2
cast,160.2,160.6
members,160.6,160.9
of,160.9,161.0
top,161.0,161.2
of,161.2,161.3
the,161.3,161.3
hill,161.3,161.6
right,161.6,161.7
so,161.7,161.9
I,161.9,162.0
had,162.0,162.1
this,162.1,162.2
big,162.2,162.4
sloping,162.4,163.1
Hill,163.1,163.2
next,163.2,163.5
to,163.5,163.5
my,163.5,163.7
house,163.7,164.0
and,164.0,164.1
it,164.1,164.2
was,164.2,164.3
asphalt,164.3,164.6
it,164.6,164.9
so,164.9,165.0
it,165.0,165.2
might,165.2,165.3
be,165.3,165.8
good,165.8,166.1
for,166.1,166.2
Speed,166.2,167.1
2,167.1,167.2
actually,167.2,172.0
is,172.0,172.1
actually,172.1,172.2
enjoy,172.2,172.5

quite,172.8,173.2
a,173.2,173.2
lot,173.2,173.4
so,173.4,173.6
it,173.6,173.7
is,173.7,173.9
with,173.9,174.1
that,174.1,174.2
involves,174.2,174.6
down,174.6,174.9
kind,174.9,175.1

I,197.7,197.9
was,197.9,198.0
still,198.0,198.1

screaming,210.8,211.3
and,211.3,211.5
crying,211.5,211.9
she,211.9,212.6
was,212.6,212.9
screaming,212.9,213.4
and,213.4,213.5
crying,213.5,213.8
like,213.8,214.1
I,214.1,214.2
was,214.2,214.4
like,214.4,214.5
paralyzed,214.5,215.1
couldn't,215.1,215.4
do,215.4,215.5
anything,215.5,215.9
like,215.9,216.3
that,216.3,216.5
so,216.5,216.8
she,216.8,216.9
had,216.9,217.0
to,217.0,217.0
run,217.0,217.2
off,217.2,217.3

myself,219.4,220.5
yeah,220.5,222.3
it,222.3,222.5
was,222.5,222.6
pretty,222.6,222.7
aggressive,222.7,231.9
team,231.9,232.3
that,232.3,232.5
was,232.5,232.8
very,232.8,233.2
very,233.2,233.4
stupid,233.4,234.0
very,243.5,245.1
quiet,245.1,245.4
after,245.4,249.3
6,249.3,254.0
months,254.0,254.9
I,254.9,255.2
think,255.2,255.4
and,255.4,255.6
then,255.6,255.8
she,255.8,256.0
let,256.0,256.3
me,256.3,256.9
know,256.9,257.0
that,257.0,257.2

and,259.0,260.3
her,260.3,260.4
family,260.4,260.9
would,260.9,261.5
be,261.5,261.5
moving,261.5,262.0
so,262.0,262.5
it's,262.5,262.6
like,262.6,263.0
I,263.0,263.1
was,263.1,263.3
very,263.3,263.5
worried,263.5,264.6
about,264.6,264.7
this,264.7,265.1
kind,265.1,265.5
of,265.5,265.6

your,269.4,269.5
best,269.5,269.8
friend,269.8,270.2
and,270.2,270.3
she,270.3,271.0
became,271.0,271.3
kind,271.3,279.8
of,279.8,279.9
the,279.9,280.3
when,280.3,281.3
she,281.3,281.4
did,281.4,281.5
move,281.5,281.7
over,281.7,281.9
there,281.9,282.1
I,282.1,282.2
tried,282.2,282.3
to,282.3,282.4
call,282.4,282.7
and,282.7,282.8
it,282.8,282.9
didn't,282.9,283.1
work,283.1,283.7
too,283.7,284.1
well,284.1,284.2
kind,284.2,284.7
of,284.7,284.8
weather,284.8,292.0
we,292.0,292.2
get,292.2,292.3
in,292.3,292.4
touch,292.4,292.5
with,292.5,292.7
each,292.7,292.7
other,292.7,292.8
so,292.8,293.0
just,293.0,293.1
kind,293.1,293.4
of,293.4,293.4
disappeared,293.4,293.7
in,293.7,293.9
which,293.9,294.0
was,294.0,294.3
when,294.3,295.5
you,295.5,295.7
were,295.7,295.8
younger,295.8,296.2
so,301.3,302.2
that,302.2,302.3
would,302.3,302.4
be,302.4,302.5
kind,302.5,313.6
of,313.6,313.6

was,316.2,316.3
about,316.3,316.4
5,316.4,316.8
years,316.8,316.9
