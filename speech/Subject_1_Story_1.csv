kind,276.5,278.7
of,278.7,278.8
like,278.8,279.1
cuz,279.1,279.2
I,279.2,279.3
was,279.3,279.4
very,279.4,279.5
introverted,279.5,279.8
even,279.8,280.3
like,280.3,280.7
where,280.7,280.9
I,280.9,281.0
live,281.0,281.0
before,281.0,281.2
kind,281.2,281.8
of,281.8,281.9
so,281.9,282.1
it,282.1,282.3
was,282.3,282.5
a,282.5,282.7
big,282.7,282.9
pain,282.9,283.2
to,283.2,283.3
lose,283.3,283.5
a,283.5,283.6
friend,283.6,283.9
like,283.9,284.1
that,284.1,284.2
and,285.9,286.5
I'm,286.5,286.7
sure,286.7,286.9
I,286.9,287.9
did,287.9,288.1
eventually,288.1,288.5
it's,290.2,290.7
nice,290.7,290.9
to,290.9,291.0
get,291.0,291.0
back,291.0,291.1
in,291.1,291.3
contact,291.3,291.3
with,291.3,291.7
her,291.7,291.8
like,291.8,292.2
I,292.2,292.6
think,292.6,292.8
it,292.8,293.0
was,293.0,293.1
about,293.1,293.4
like,293.4,295.3
a,295.3,296.1
couple,296.1,296.5
of,296.5,296.6
years,296.6,296.7
after,296.7,297.3
she,297.3,297.5
had,297.5,297.6
moved,297.6,297.8
I,297.8,297.9
got,297.9,298.0
the,298.0,298.1
touch,298.1,298.2
with,298.2,298.4
her,298.4,298.5
again,298.5,298.6
and,298.6,299.9
we,299.9,300.0
started,300.0,300.3
to,300.3,300.4
talk,300.4,300.5
about,300.5,300.8
like,300.8,301.4
I,301.4,302.3
think,302.3,302.4
it,302.4,302.5
was,302.5,302.6
kind,302.6,302.7
of,302.7,302.8
made,302.8,302.9
me,302.9,303.0
about,303.0,303.2
what,303.2,304.0
she,304.0,315.1
changed,315.1,315.3
from,315.3,316.9
what,316.9,317.0
I,317.0,317.1
remember,317.1,317.5
to,317.5,317.7
contact,317.7,318.5
with,318.5,318.7
me,318.7,318.8
so,318.8,319.0
I,319.0,319.1
was,319.1,319.2
really,319.2,319.4
hoping,319.4,319.8
that,319.8,319.9
we,319.9,320.2
could,320.2,320.3
talk,320.3,320.4
about,320.4,320.7
the,320.7,320.8
past,320.8,321.2
and,321.2,321.3
I,321.3,321.3
told,321.3,321.5
you,321.5,321.6
about,321.6,321.6
who,321.6,321.8
is,321.8,322.0
nostalgic,322.0,322.5
things,322.5,322.8
but,322.8,323.5
I,323.5,323.6
think,323.6,323.8
she,323.8,324.0
changed,324.0,324.1
a,324.1,324.5
lot,324.5,324.7
like,324.7,325.4
when,325.4,325.5
you,325.5,325.8
don't,325.8,326.7
see,326.7,326.9
people,326.9,327.1
for,327.1,327.3
a,327.3,327.4
long,327.4,327.5
time,327.5,327.7
like,327.7,328.1
they,328.1,328.3
changed,328.3,328.6
quite,328.6,328.9
a,328.9,329.0
long,329.0,329.2
time,329.2,329.4
and,329.4,330.2
I,330.2,330.4
thought,330.4,330.6
that,330.6,330.7
we,330.7,330.9
could,330.9,330.9
have,330.9,331.2
like,331.2,331.5
limbo,331.5,331.8
under,331.8,332.0
the,332.0,332.4
stuff,332.4,332.8
that,332.8,332.9
we,332.9,333.0
didn't,333.0,333.1
know,333.1,333.2
that,333.2,333.3
was,333.3,333.4
interested,333.4,339.3
in,339.3,339.3
seeing,339.3,340.0
me,340.0,340.1
pushing,340.1,340.8
the,340.8,340.8
conversation,340.8,341.5
kind,341.5,341.9
of,341.9,342.0
them,342.0,342.5
I'm,343.1,343.6
the,343.6,343.8
answer,343.8,344.2
eventually,344.2,345.7
we,345.7,346.1
buy,346.1,346.4
kept,346.4,346.6
trying,346.6,346.9
to,346.9,347.0
push,347.0,347.2
the,347.2,347.3
conversation,347.3,347.5
but,347.5,348.0
I,348.0,355.2
know,355.2,355.3
it's,355.3,356.3
been,356.3,356.4
awhile,356.4,356.5
since,356.5,356.8
I,356.8,357.0
heard,357.0,357.2
from,357.2,357.2
you,357.2,357.4
I,357.4,357.5
lost,357.5,357.8
so,357.8,358.2
I,358.2,358.7
think,358.7,359.0
it,359.0,359.1
was,359.1,359.2
about,359.2,359.5
4,359.5,360.4
years,360.4,360.5
maybe,360.5,360.7
so,360.7,361.7
I,361.7,361.8
haven't,361.8,362.1
heard,362.1,362.3
from,362.3,362.4
her,362.4,362.6
since,362.6,362.7
then,362.7,362.9
