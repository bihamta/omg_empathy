was,138.0,138.5
very,138.5,138.7
nervous,138.7,139.1
because,139.1,139.6
I,139.6,139.7

the,140.9,141.2
Shia,141.2,141.6
kind,141.6,141.9
of,141.9,142.0
as,142.0,142.1
opposed,142.1,142.3
to,142.3,142.4
that,142.4,142.5
point,142.5,142.8
I'm,142.8,142.9
just,142.9,143.5
having,143.5,143.8

the,144.5,144.6
inside,144.6,144.9
and,144.9,146.7
then,146.7,146.9
the,146.9,147.0
fact,147.0,147.2
that,147.2,147.3
I,147.3,147.4
was,147.4,148.8
just,148.8,149.3
terrified,149.3,149.6
it's,149.6,153.5
been,153.5,153.6
a,153.6,153.7
long,153.7,153.8
time,153.8,154.0
like,154.0,154.1
practicing,154.1,154.5
in,154.5,154.6
preparing,154.6,155.0
for,155.0,155.1
this,155.1,155.3
neighborhood,155.3,155.6
is,155.6,155.9
not,155.9,156.2
kind,156.2,156.4
of,156.4,156.5
I,156.5,162.3
was,162.3,162.4
on,162.4,162.6
that,162.6,162.7
played,162.7,162.9
on,162.9,163.0
the,163.0,163.1
radio,163.1,163.3

and,164.3,164.9
once,164.9,165.3
I,165.3,165.4
was,165.4,165.5
done,165.5,165.6
the,165.6,165.9
teacher,165.9,166.3
really,166.3,166.5
like,166.5,166.8
laid,166.8,167.1
into,167.1,167.3
my,167.3,167.5
everything,167.5,167.9
that,167.9,168.2
is,168.2,168.8
wrong,168.8,169.0
why,169.0,169.3
did,169.3,169.4
you,169.4,169.4
say,169.4,169.7
this,169.7,169.9
in,169.9,170.6
this,170.6,170.8
why,170.8,171.0
did,171.0,171.1
you,171.1,171.2
do,171.2,171.4
this,171.4,171.6
and,171.6,171.8
I,171.8,173.8
was,173.8,174.0
really,174.0,174.3
like,174.3,175.3
for,175.3,176.5
this,176.5,176.6
kind,176.6,176.8
of,176.8,176.9
those,176.9,177.0
are,177.0,177.2
very,177.2,177.2
fragile,177.2,177.6
person,177.6,177.9
so,177.9,178.4
actually,178.4,178.7
I,178.7,178.8
think,178.8,178.9
I,178.9,179.0
like,179.0,179.5
smoking,179.5,188.6
School,188.6,189.0
of,189.0,189.1
times,189.1,189.4
you,189.4,189.6
can,189.6,189.8
do,189.8,189.9
anything,189.9,190.1
about,190.1,190.3
it,190.3,190.8
but,190.8,191.1
like,191.1,191.3
the,191.3,191.4
school,191.4,191.6
said,191.6,191.8
they,191.8,191.8
basically,191.8,192.2
that,192.2,192.4
she,192.4,192.4
done,192.4,192.6
a,192.6,192.7
bunch,192.7,192.8
of,192.8,192.9
bored,192.9,193.3
you,193.3,193.4
can,193.4,193.6
get,193.6,193.7
rid,193.7,193.8
of,193.8,193.9
his,193.9,194.0
or,194.0,194.1
his,194.1,194.2
best,194.2,194.5
to,194.5,194.6
stay,194.6,195.1
and,195.1,196.8
I,196.8,196.9
can,196.9,197.0
just,197.0,197.2
deal,197.2,197.4
with,197.4,197.5
her,197.5,197.7
anymore,197.7,197.8
because,197.8,198.2
like,198.2,198.7
it,198.7,199.0
was,199.0,199.1
a,199.1,199.2
mandatory,199.2,199.4
Court,199.4,199.7
short,199.7,200.1
time,200.1,200.9
to,200.9,201.0
live,201.0,201.1
for,201.1,201.3
Note,201.3,201.5
3,201.5,201.5
years,201.5,201.8
we,201.8,203.0
discussed,203.0,203.5
and,203.5,203.6
