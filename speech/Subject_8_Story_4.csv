man,0.7000000000000001,0.9
I,0.9,1.0
had,1.0,2.8
this,2.8,3.0
terrible,3.0,3.3
terrible,3.3,3.6
experience,3.6,5.1
a,5.1,5.2
couple,5.2,5.5
of,5.5,5.6
weeks,5.6,5.8
pregnant,5.8,6.0
and,6.0,6.5
I,6.5,12.7
don't,12.7,13.1
know,13.1,13.2
something,13.2,13.6
about,13.6,13.8
it,13.8,14.0
just,14.0,14.1
gives,14.1,14.5
me,14.5,14.6
a,14.6,15.1
lot,15.1,15.3
and,15.3,16.0
a,16.0,16.2
couple,16.2,16.4
of,16.4,16.5
weeks,16.5,16.5
ago,16.5,16.8
I,16.8,17.0
was,17.0,17.2
starting,17.2,17.7
to,17.7,17.9
sweat,17.9,18.6
during,18.6,18.8
as,18.8,19.2
I,19.2,19.3
told,19.3,19.5
you,19.5,19.6
and,19.6,20.4
I,20.4,20.7
found,20.7,22.8
this,22.8,23.1
really,23.1,23.3
cheap,23.3,23.7
flight,23.7,24.0
online.,24.0,24.8
We,24.8,25.2
are,25.2,25.3
booked,25.3,25.5
way,25.5,25.7
in,25.7,25.7
advance,25.7,26.0
so,26.0,26.5
that,26.5,26.6
is,26.6,26.8
not,26.8,27.0
a,27.0,27.2
problem,27.2,27.4
but,27.4,27.7
I'm,27.7,28.0
not,28.0,28.6
sure,28.6,28.7
about,28.7,28.9
my,28.9,29.2
plans,29.2,29.3
are,29.3,29.8
to,29.8,30.4
take,30.4,30.7
this,30.7,30.8
flight,30.8,31.4
very,31.4,33.2
last,33.2,33.6
minute,33.6,33.8
I,33.8,34.2
found,34.2,34.5
this,34.5,34.7
cheap,34.7,34.9
one,34.9,35.1
of,35.1,35.3
these,35.3,35.5
some,35.5,35.7
of,35.7,35.8
these,35.8,35.9
last,35.9,36.7
minute,36.7,36.8
deals,36.8,37.2
website,37.2,37.8
so,37.8,38.4
I,38.4,38.4
took,38.4,38.6
that,38.6,38.8
is,38.8,39.9
really,39.9,40.1
cheap,40.1,40.2
so,40.2,40.5
I,40.5,40.6
love,40.6,40.8
well,40.8,41.1
it's,41.1,41.2
just,41.2,41.3
an,41.3,41.4
hour,41.4,41.6
flight,41.6,41.9
1,41.9,42.3
hour,42.3,42.3
15,42.3,42.7
minutes,42.7,42.9
of,42.9,43.0
a,43.0,43.2
canopy,43.2,43.7
evening,43.7,45.7
flight,45.7,46.0
pretty,46.0,46.3
much,46.3,46.5
like,46.5,46.7
the,46.7,46.7
last,46.7,47.0
flight,47.0,47.3
of,47.3,47.4
the,47.4,47.5
day,47.5,47.7
it,47.7,48.1
was,48.1,48.2
at,48.2,48.4
9,48.4,48.8
p.m.,48.8,49.5
or,49.5,49.7
9:30,49.7,50.2
p.m.,50.2,50.3
or,50.3,50.6
something,50.6,50.9
so,50.9,51.6
me,51.6,52.2
being,52.2,52.3
me,52.3,52.6
I,52.6,52.7
just,52.7,52.9
reached,52.9,53.2
the,53.2,53.3
airport,53.3,53.4
2,53.4,53.7
hours,53.7,53.8
before,53.8,54.3
the,54.3,54.7
time,54.7,55.0
also,55.0,56.5
was,56.5,57.7
not,57.7,57.8
that,57.8,57.9
good,57.9,58.1
a,58.1,58.2
little,58.2,58.2
bit,58.2,58.5
rainy,58.5,58.8
and,58.8,59.1
windy,59.1,59.5
so,59.5,59.9
I,59.9,59.9
thought,59.9,60.1
maybe,60.1,60.2
it's,60.3,60.6
just,60.6,60.8
in,60.8,61.3
case,61.3,61.5
something,61.5,61.8
goes,61.8,61.9
wrong,61.9,62.1
and,62.1,63.2
not,63.2,64.4
to,64.4,64.6
my,64.6,64.7
surprise,64.7,64.9
is,64.9,66.1
my,66.1,66.3
plan,66.3,66.8
as,66.8,67.0
soon,67.0,67.2
as,67.2,67.4
I,67.4,67.6
enter,67.6,67.8
the,67.8,67.9
airport,67.9,68.2
there's,68.2,68.7
a,68.7,68.7
huge,68.7,69.2
you,69.2,69.4
for,69.4,69.6
checking,69.6,70.0
up,70.0,70.8
on,70.8,70.9
me,70.9,71.1
all,71.1,71.3
the,71.3,71.4
flights,71.4,71.8
before,71.8,72.6
were,72.6,72.8
delayed,72.8,73.1
because,73.1,73.2
of,73.2,73.5
the,73.5,73.5
bad,73.5,73.8
weather,73.8,73.9
here,73.9,74.2
and,74.2,75.5
talk,75.5,76.2
to,76.2,78.1
people,78.1,78.4
completely,78.4,79.1
like,79.1,79.5
the,79.5,79.8
check,79.8,80.0
in,80.0,80.1
his,80.1,80.2
folder,80.2,80.7
is,80.7,80.8
completely,80.8,83.2
gone,83.2,85.2
even,85.2,85.5
movements,85.5,86.1
in,86.1,86.2
the,86.2,86.3
whole,86.3,86.5
thing,86.5,86.6
and,86.6,86.8
somehow,86.8,88.1
I,88.1,88.9
barely,88.9,89.7
managed,89.7,90.1
to,90.1,90.2
reach,90.2,90.4
the,90.4,90.5
boarding,90.5,90.9
gate,90.9,91.0
before,91.0,91.5

closed,91.8,92.2
like,92.2,92.5
5,92.5,92.8
minutes,92.8,93.0
before,93.0,93.1
close,93.1,93.7
to,93.7,94.5
go,94.5,94.7
running,94.7,95.0
my,95.0,95.1
way,95.1,95.3

check,95.5,95.9
into,95.9,96.2
Security,96.2,96.9
in,96.9,97.0
this,97.0,97.2
somehow,97.2,97.5
making,97.5,97.8
it,97.8,98.0
through,98.0,98.2
these,98.2,99.5
guys,99.5,99.7
are,99.7,99.9
not,99.9,99.9
happy,99.9,100.4
with,100.4,100.7
me,100.7,100.9
because,100.9,101.0
I,101.0,101.3
was,101.3,101.4
kind,101.4,101.9
of,101.9,102.1
just,102.1,102.2
on,102.2,102.5
time,102.5,102.8
and,102.8,103.8
so,103.8,104.4
they,104.4,104.6
just,104.6,104.7
let,104.7,104.9
me,104.9,105.0

but,105.3,105.4
they,105.4,105.5
were,105.5,105.6
visibly,105.6,106.4
one,106.4,106.7
that,106.7,106.9
and,106.9,108.7
you,108.7,108.8
know,108.8,108.9
some,108.9,109.2
of,109.2,109.3
some,109.3,109.7
of,109.7,109.7
these,109.7,109.9
guys,109.9,110.1
don't,110.1,110.3
have,110.3,110.6
this,110.6,110.7
bitch,110.7,111.0
connections,111.0,111.5
to,111.5,111.7
the,111.7,111.7
planes,111.7,112.1
have,112.1,112.3
to,112.3,112.4
go,112.4,112.6
down,112.6,112.8
and,112.8,112.9
take,112.9,113.1
the,113.1,113.2
bus,113.2,113.4
and,113.4,113.8
one,113.8,115.0
of,115.0,115.1
the,115.1,115.2
most,115.2,115.4
annoying,115.4,115.7
things,115.7,116.0
I,116.0,116.4
hate,116.4,117.3
cuz,117.3,118.0
I,118.0,118.1
just,118.1,118.5
backed,118.5,118.9
into,118.9,119.0
the,119.0,119.2
small,119.2,119.6
bus,119.6,120.0
like,120.0,120.2
that,120.2,120.2
go,120.3,120.5
to,120.5,120.6
sleep,120.6,121.0
and,121.0,121.1
then,121.1,121.2
you,121.2,121.3
take,121.3,121.5
him,121.5,121.7
somewhere,121.7,122.0
and,122.0,122.2
dropped,122.2,122.6
off,122.6,122.8
and,122.8,123.6
so,123.6,123.9
we,123.9,124.0
took,124.0,124.1
the,124.1,124.3
bus,124.3,124.4
and,124.4,124.7
as,124.7,125.1
soon,125.1,125.4
as,125.4,125.4
we,125.4,125.6
stared,125.6,126.2
airplane,126.2,127.1
I,127.1,128.1
see,128.1,128.3
this,128.3,128.4
really,128.4,128.9
small,128.9,129.4
propeller,129.4,130.1
plane,130.1,130.7
like,130.7,131.0
60,131.0,131.4
70,131.4,131.8
feet,131.8,132.0
are,132.0,132.2
really,132.2,132.4
small,132.4,132.8
one,132.8,133.2
I,133.2,133.7
hate,133.7,134.0
the,134.0,134.3
propeller,134.3,134.6
planes,134.6,134.9
because,134.9,135.2
I'm,135.2,135.3
always,135.3,135.5
scared,135.5,135.9
flying,135.9,136.1
in,136.1,136.3
them,136.3,136.5
I,136.5,136.6
don't,136.6,136.8
know,136.8,136.9
why,136.9,137.3
it's,137.3,137.6
about,137.6,137.9
I,137.9,139.2
don't,139.2,139.4
trust,139.4,139.7
the,139.7,139.8
place,139.8,140.1
nice,140.1,144.6
if,144.6,144.7
they,144.7,144.8
made,144.8,145.1
when,145.1,145.2
they,145.2,145.4
when,145.4,145.6
they,145.6,145.7
flying,145.7,146.0
is,146.0,146.2
too,146.2,146.4
scary,146.4,146.7
for,146.7,146.9
me,146.9,147.0
not,147.0,149.2
much,149.2,149.4
I,149.4,149.5
could,149.5,149.7
do,149.7,149.8
right,149.8,150.0
so,150.0,150.2
I,150.2,150.3
just,150.3,150.5
boarded,150.5,151.0
the,151.0,151.2
plane,151.2,151.3
as,151.3,155.9
soon,155.9,156.0
as,156.0,156.1
possible,156.1,156.3
and,156.3,156.7
get,156.7,156.8
seated,156.8,157.2
so,157.2,157.7
that,157.7,157.8
they,157.8,157.9
could,157.9,158.1
take,158.1,158.3
off,158.3,158.6
to,158.6,160.8
be,160.8,160.9
honest,160.9,161.2
no.,161.2,161.6
We,161.6,164.5
sat,164.5,164.8
on,164.8,165.0

to,167.8,167.9
my,167.9,168.0
seat,168.0,168.3
and,168.3,168.6
just,168.6,169.6

myself,169.9,170.0
in,170.0,170.4
and,170.4,171.5
then,171.5,171.7
they,171.7,171.9
might,171.9,176.4
have,176.4,176.6
to,176.6,176.7
wait,176.7,177.0
for,177.0,177.1
some,177.1,178.6

and,178.9,179.0
I,179.0,179.1
would,179.1,179.3
like,179.3,179.3
why,179.3,179.7

way,366.6,366.7
back,366.7,366.9
and,366.9,367.7
I,367.7,368.1
don't,368.1,368.5
think,368.5,368.6
I,368.6,368.8
can,368.8,369.0
drive,369.0,369.2
it,369.2,369.4
back,369.4,369.5
in,369.5,369.8
these,369.8,369.9
this,369.9,370.4
propeller,370.4,371.3
plane,371.3,371.6
flights,371.6,372.0
again,372.0,372.1
especially,372.1,373.0
in,373.0,373.3
the,373.3,373.4
night,373.4,373.7
so,373.7,373.8
I'm,373.8,374.1
going,374.1,374.1
to,374.1,374.2
make,374.2,374.4
sure,374.4,374.6
that,374.6,374.7
I,374.7,374.9
check,374.9,375.0
the,375.0,375.3
flight,375.3,375.7
timings,375.7,376.1
and,376.1,376.4
I'm,376.4,377.1
pretty,377.1,377.3
sure,377.3,377.4
about,377.4,377.7
that,377.7,377.9
is,377.9,378.3
not,378.3,378.6
a,378.6,378.7
propeller,378.7,379.2
plane,379.2,379.2
it's,379.2,379.5
a,379.5,379.6
big,379.6,379.8
plane,379.8,380.1
that,380.1,380.3
I,380.3,380.9
apply,380.9,381.4
on,381.4,381.5
and,381.5,381.8
and,381.8,382.1
never,382.1,382.5
have,382.5,382.7
to,382.7,382.8
experience,382.8,383.2
again,383.2,383.5
I,383.5,383.7
hope,383.7,383.9
it,383.9,384.2
doesn't,384.2,384.4
happen,384.4,384.5
with,384.5,384.8
the,384.8,385.0
other,385.0,385.1
bigger,385.1,385.5
planes,385.5,385.9
but,385.9,386.9
this,386.9,387.0
was,387.0,387.2
like,387.2,387.3
one,387.3,387.5
of,387.5,387.5
the,387.5,387.6
worst,387.6,388.0
things,388.0,388.1
that,388.1,388.3
I,388.3,388.5
have,388.5,388.7
gone,388.7,388.9
through,388.9,389.0
my,389.0,389.6
